# PSYCH 356

## Week 1 - Myth (Jan 5)

Main theme: living well in anxious times. How do people live "sophisticated" lives under anxious circumstances.

People sometimes learn habitual reactions. Become "agentic", do something strong. One way to suppress anxiety is to activate agency. An agentic reaction is like saying "yeah, I'm fine", when not really.

Idealism is another kind of agentic reaction. Become certain that we are certain. Exaggeratedly confident. These things can regulate the anxiety system. But these things can cause a personal change. Anxiety is important. If we blunt it, we lose our capacity to self regulate efficiently.
Can become deluded or out of tough with reality.

We can get a myopic focus on our goals when we are hyper-agentic. Motivation tunnel-vision. Sever our connection with other people. Eg, in narcissism, other people are just tools for our goals.

A big part of personality is having interpersonal connections, hyper-agency can make this challenging/strained.

Researchers advocate for mindful, balanced solutions,

### Cave Art

4000 BCE. Tribe of humans who are co-habitating Earth with Neanderthals. All throughout Earth, there are caves with cave paintings.

Life was rough - half of children survived, life expectancy was 30. Why did people spend their times painting beasts on the walls? Many of these caves are inaccessible, unlikely to be home art. Sometimes there are musical instruments in the caves as well - maybe the acoustics were good there.
Maybe they are hunting rituals. Unlikely, because the animals painted weren't really eaten much. Lots of images of bison, but mostly reindeer were eaten.

His speculation on these caves is informed by the other topics of the course. A lot of the other things are related to overcoming a large "beast" in a dark cave/space and a ritual of escaping this beast.
This speculation frames the rest of the course.
Initiation tradition to cope with hyper-agency. Deal with this scary experience and overcome it. Humans are very social, need to be communally connected to survive. Can't be very powerful when alone in a cave. Scared the young people full of bravado by putting them in a dark scary cave.

Getting over or working with human capacity for hyper-agency. Fascination with bulls in many myths and contemporary culture (for example, mechanical bulls, cowboys, matadors). How do we deal with the bull?

One of the oldest/wisest cultures was in Minoan Crete. They had lots of figures of people jumping over bulls. Both men and women, combining the genders.
Similar ideas occurred in Egypt, Sumeria, Crete, Greece, eventually India. The idea was that people need to integrate feminine with masculine. Balance hyper-agency with psychological femininity.

### Epic of Gilgamesh

Sumeric epic story. Tells of Gilgamesh, the mighty king who slayed beasts and animals. Was very full of himself. Made all women have sex with him.
Was a very anxious and unsafe time. He was described as very mighty, killed monsters. When goddess of love, Ishtar offered love and affections, he told her to GTFO because he was busy.
She got annoyed, so she sent the bull of heaven down to punish them. Gilgamesh and friend kill the bull of heaven, so she is mad. She kills the friend, Gilgamesh's only friend. He is great, but he is alone.
He runs around the world in anguish, looking for a solution. Is scared of dying as well.
He finds someone who became immortal. He survived because (when the God's sent a flood for the "clamoring ambition") he built an arc.
But this won't happen again the guy says, so Gilgamesh is really upset and is in despair. All the hyper-agency he has is useless.
He rebuffs love, says no to communal connection.

### Isis, Osiris, Horus

2500 BCE. Osiris and Seth were competing the head Gods. They are brothers. They up the ante, and Seth decides he's going to take Osiris down.
One version, he shows Osiris a beautiful and ornate coffin and tells him to try it. Osiris hops in and Seth suffocates him. Metaphor for frustration, lack of power.
Other version - slices up into pieces and throws into the desert.
Other version - disintegrates in the sea.

In all versions, Isis doesn't give up on him. She suffers and grieves, and finds all his pieces and reconstitutes him and resurrects him. Hovers above him and conceives Horus, the sky God.
There is a descent into despair and desperation, then a period of mourning, and then a reconstitution into a higher being.
Horus is made up of all parts except the phallus, she uses a golden dildo for that part to create Horus.
It was platonic love. Symbolic of compassionate love. Through this compassionate attention, that true power was born in Horus. They ruled together as a trinity.

Osiris is often considered lord of the dead, or lord of love. Also identified with bull. Isis has the cow horns, associated with fertility.

Balance between agency and community.

### Crete's Minoan Civilization

Trading civilization mostly. Had access to many cultures all around the Mediterranean. Have to be psychologically sophisticated enough to deal with different cultures. Saturated with symbolism of integrating the feminine with the masculine, or the community with agency.

Collapsed around 1450 BCE. These seeds of cultural sophistication were dispersed around the Greek islands are resurfaces as Greek culture.

Often female goddesses riding bulls (feminine with masculine). Priestesses were all women. Held symbols of things that were uncertain or mysteries. Like snakes or cats.

### Dionysus

Similar story (symbolically) to Osiris. Was the progeny of Zeus and Demeter/Persephone. Was illegitimate. Zeus cheated on Hera and could Dionysys. Hera was pissed so she sent the titans to cut him into pieces when he was a child. The titans came and they cut him into pieces, but before they finished, Zeus threw a lightning bolt. The only piece that survived of Dionysus survived.

Senele implanted the heart into her thigh, and he grew again (was born again). He was nurtured to life by the compassionate life.

Common people would participate in the rituals, would enact the grief for the dead Osiris, then they would descend into the tomb, then would have some kind of ritual (mystery because kept serious). Some scary parts of ritual, some communal elements, some conviction to live better lives when they emerged. Socrates/Plato believed they were very important for instilling morality in people.

Descend into the darkness, pop out 3 days later. Same with Dionysus, except more alcohol. Disenfranchised people would do this often.
Always something scary, like killing an animal, then a rave, then other stuff, then come out full of moral conviction. Mediated by female priestesses.

Dionysus is pictures as very feminine, and androgynous. Experiences his vulnerability, exists because of compassionate intervention.

### Elusinian mysteries

Greek version - very similar. Hades, Persephone, and Demeter.

Perseophone (daughter of Demeter) was minding her own business, and Hades seized her into the underworld. Demeter was very upset. Symbol of platonic love. Demeter searched far and wide, never gave up, finally manages to rescue Persephone from the underworld.

Everything dies when she is down there, and everything grows again when Persephone returns.

People participated in the grief of Demeter, descended in to the cave in the side of a mountain. Stay there overnight, have a ritual, then emerge again.

### Mycenaeans: Strife in the House of Atreus

Minoan Crete collapsed around 1450 BCE.
Mycenaean Greece took over after (Sparta, war-like). Like the Iliad.

Flourished and dominated for many years, and then also collapsed, then archaic Greece began.

People think the Minoan seeds grew up again in archaic Greek culture. Much of the archaic Greek literature seems to be a tale of how not to be like the Mycenaeans, and the war culture. Almost no artwork in that period. Conquest-based civilization.

Archaic Greeks told stories about the era before them, the Mycenaeans:

Tantalus wants to be like the Gods, wants to be immortal. In an effort to make his child immortal, he cuts Pelops into pieces and serves him as food for the Gods. Disregard for communal care and hyper-agency.
His punishment is eternal frustration. He can't reach the fruit tree or drink from the pond.
The only person who ate Pelops was Demeter because she was upset about Persephone.

Pelops is somehow put back together, also has bad behaviour. Pelops' kids, Atreus do the same thing. Atreus cooked his brothers kids and taunted him with their limbs.
Complete disregard for care and community. Atreus' kids are Menelaus (King of Sparta) and Agamemnon (main general).

Trojan war began when Menelaus (king) and Helen (wife, most beautiful woman). Paris takes Helen (feminity) away to Troy. They become even more hyper-agentic.
Menelaus and Agammemnon are super angry, and go to sack Troy. It's not going well, so Agammemnon sacrifices his daughter to improve their chances. This makes his wife mad, and he is eventually killed by her.
All this strife in the house of Atreus.

Chriseis (Menelaus' concubine). He is told to give her back by the Gods. So Menelaus gives her back, and steals Achilles' sex slave, Bryseus. Now Achilles (greatest fighter) is now very angry. He decides to not fight for the Greeks anymore. Trojans are now winning, Achilles' countrymen are being slaughtered.

Achilles' mother was a flaming narcissist. Thesus has to marry a mortal, the mother. And they had half-mortal Achilles. She tried to singe off the mortal parts of him to make him fully immortal. So he is very angry at his mother, becomes hyper-agentic.

While he was away with the barge, Achilles' friend was killed (just like Gilgamesh). In his anger, he fights back and wins the battle. In the end, he dies in Troy even after they win. Too agentic.

Once he defeats Hector (other side's biggest warrior), he desecrates his body, which eventually leads to his death. Personal and social cost to hyper-agency in this family.

### The Iliad : Achilles and the Siege of Troy

Achilles was from the house of Atreus. They were callous and lacking compassion for their children, and further propagated the hyper-agency in their family. All about honour and teaching lessons.

### Odyssey

First part was the Iliad (avenge the stealing of Helen and sack Troy.) They won that battle. Second part of the story was getting home and living a long and generative healthy life.

Achilles never got home, never became wise, got truncutated at a childish phase/stage. Odysseus on the other hand, was "cool" and clever, capable, like the Cretans. Capable of seeing other perspectives, and having relationships with other people. Gave him special powers to not be like Achilles.

He had the idea for the Trojan horse, was able to end the war. He could understand most people, knew they were deluded and vulnerable to flattery (Trojan horse).

The Odyssey is the story of Odysseus returning home. Childhood development and then adult development. How to live well in society as an adult.

He is really good at handling frustration, is very different from Achilles. Suffers many trials along the way of the journey, deals with the frustrations.

First one is the island, his men become distracted with the Lotus flowers, and the islanders kill some. But Odysseus forgives them (because he needed them to get home). Maintained good relationships.

Similar story with the cyclops, who has no perspective. Really nice contrast to Odysseus who is really good at taking perspective. Does the clever trick with name "Nobody". Very clever guy who sees it from both ways. They escape under sheep.

Odysseus keeps getting blown of course, representative of life's journey of suffering. Whenever he lands on a new island, he manages to maintain a relationship with people there and continually learn and grow.

Learns to be okay with uncertainty. Experiences anxiety without becoming hyper-agentic.

### Self-Knowledge: Circe and the Delphic Oracle

Odysseus ends up on an island with Circe and she turns his men into pigs. But Odysseus has already gotten the antidote, so they sleep together instead, and she turns the the pigs back to men. And she gives him tips from the future. She explains to him about the sirens, and plugging his ears.

Freud believed we need to understand this murky underworld to understand ourselves.

Odysseus goes to the underworld and sees miserable people due to hyper-agency.

Odysseus finally gets home to Ithaca, and Penelope is waiting there for him, and he manages to finish his life's course.
The home is a communal connection.  

Feminine mysterious understanding of emotions (Circe) comes up very often. The Delphic oracle is similar. Temple to Apollo in Delphi. Apollo was a God who came over from Crete (swam) with a bunch of dolphins with priestesses on their backs and brought them to Delphi (related to the word for womb). He is another feminized God.

The first thing Apollo does is visit the underworld, and exposes himself and slays a dragon. He takes one of the priestesses and installs her as the Delphic oracle. She sits in the temple and people come to her for advice. She would inhale fumes coming from the cracks in the floor and would mutter back some "wisdom" in the form of riddles. Like a zen riddle.
People tried to take symbolic meaning from these riddles.
Related to what Freud and Jung think about subconscious messages.
Over the door to the temple it said "Know Thyself" and over the other door was "Nothing in Excess". Both logical knowing and feminine, self knowing.

### Labyrinth and Minotaur

It is tempting to respond with hyper-agency but that doesn't end well.

Labyrinth of king Minos in Greece that had a minotaur (half man, half bull). Every year, 10 girls and boys from Athens were fed to the minotaur. This was king Minos' revenge because his son was killed by a bull in Athens.
Was a sad event every year.

One year, Prince Theseus decided to go. He was very brave and agentic and volounteered. His Dad told him to put a black sail on if he is dead, and white sail if he is alive, when the boat returns.

Thesues when he gets there, makes friends with Ariadne who is the daughter of Daedalyus who made the maze. They are thrown into the maze (metaphor of adolescence). He is clever like Odysseus was, and puts down string to see how to get back out.

Theseus kills the minotaur. He rushes out the maze, hurries everyone to go home. Forgets about Ariadne and leaves her there, and she gets punished. Becomes hyper-agentic. Forgets to change the sail, it is a black sail. His father Ageus, kills himself (called the Agean sea). Theseus became unbalanced and suffered a personal/social cost.

### Icarus

Similar story here. Daedalus and Icarus were put into jail when Theseus succeeded. They fashioned wings to fly out. Daedalus tells Icarus to not fly too close to the sun or the ocean, fly the middle course, nothing to excess. Icarus flies too close to the sun and melts his wings and perishes in the sea. Metaphor for huberis, hyper-agency.

### Oedipus

Was a prince. The King heard a prophecy that he was going to kill his wife the Queen, so he bound his feet and cast him away. Another family took him in.

He heard the prophecy that he was going to kill his father and marry his mother so he left his home. At a crossroads he meets the King, and kills his father the King over the right of way (metaphor). He solves the riddle of the Sphinx and is given the Kingdom and his given Jacosta, his mother, as a bride, fulfilling the prophecy.

He is filled with anguish, Jacosta kills herself, and then he blinds himself. Extremes people go to when they are faced with anxious struggles early on.

### Prometheus

Even if the hyper-agency is for a good cause, it can still backfire. Prometheus goes to the Gods and asks if he can give people fire and Zeus says no. He steals the fire and gives the fire to the humans. This hubristic challenging of the Gods causes him a lifetime of torment. Has his liver pecked out every day, and grown in overnight. Perpetual anguish over his ambition and agency.

### Aesop on pride

Pride can distort perception of pride. Socrates thought Aesop's fables were very important.

Story of the fox and the crow. We all want to think that we are great, we are deluded. The crow is deluded. The fox says "you are beautiful crow" and the crow is like "ya". And the crow had cheese in his mouth. The fox tells the crow that he must be able to sing super well, and so the crow drops the cheese and the fox takes it. How our pride can make us vulnerable to our delusions.

The fox and the grapes. "The grapes are probably sour anyway" because he can't reach them. Losing touch with reality.

The tortoise and the hare. I'm so great, I don't need to try, end up losing dramatically when we are hopped up on pride.

### Narcissus

He was very talented/skilled/good-looking. Admired himself. Echo had borderline personality disorder. Narcissus had everything about him. He ignored beautiful Echo because he was so obsessed with his reflection and eventually wasted away.

Echo couldn't generate anything of her own, could only respond to others. Ended up dying of loneliness.

Narcissus is classic example of hyper-agency.

### Course Themes

- Anxiety is a big part of human existence.
- hyper-agency is a way people try to cope with anxiety
- this comes with a personal cost
- makes people lose touch with reality and community
- Odysseus and Greek solutions are about mindfulness, balance, and communal solutions
