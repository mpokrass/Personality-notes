## Week 1 - Myth (Jan 5) 

Main theme: living well in anxious times. How do people live "sophisticated" lives under anxious circumstances.

People sometimes learn habitual reactions. Become "agentic", do something strong. One way to suppress anxiety is to activate agency. An agentic reaction is like saying "yeah, I'm fine", when not really.

Idealism is another kind of agentic reaction. Become certain that we are certain. Exaggeratedly confident. These things can regulate the anxiety system. But these things can cause a personal change. Anxiety is important. If we blunt it, we lose our capacity to self regulate efficiently.
Can become deluded or out of tough with reality.

We can get a myopic focus on our goals when we are hyper-agentic. Motivation tunnel-vision. Sever our connection with other people. Eg, in narcissism, other people are just tools for our goals.

A big part of personality is having interpersonal connections, hyper-agency can make this challenging/strained.

Researchers advocate for mindful, balanced solutions,

### Cave Art

4000 BCE. Tribe of humans who are co-habitating Earth with Neanderthals. All throughout Earth, there are caves with cave paintings.

Life was rough - half of children survived, life expectancy was 30. Why did people spend their times painting beasts on the walls? Many of these caves are inaccessible, unlikely to be home art. Sometimes there are musical instruments in the caves as well - maybe the acoustics were good there.
Maybe they are hunting rituals. Unlikely, because the animals painted weren't really eaten much. Lots of images of bison, but mostly reindeer were eaten.

His speculation on these caves is informed by the other topics of the course. A lot of the other things are related to overcoming a large "beast" in a dark cave/space and a ritual of escaping this beast.
This speculation frames the rest of the course.
Initiation tradition to cope with hyper-agency. Deal with this scary experience and overcome it. Humans are very social, need to be communally connected to survive. Can't be very powerful when alone in a cave. Scared the young people full of bravado by putting them in a dark scary cave.

Getting over or working with human capacity for hyper-agency. Fascination with bulls in many myths and contemporary culture (for example, mechanical bulls, cowboys, matadors). How do we deal with the bull?

One of the oldest/wisest cultures was in Minoan Crete. They had lots of figures of people jumping over bulls. Both men and women, combining the genders.
Similar ideas occurred in Egypt, Sumeria, Crete, Greece, eventually India. The idea was that people need to integrate feminine with masculine. Balance hyper-agency with psychological femininity.

### Epic of Gilgamesh

Sumeric epic story. Tells of Gilgamesh, the mighty king who slayed beasts and animals. Was very full of himself. Made all women have sex with him.
Was a very anxious and unsafe time. He was described as very mighty, killed monsters. When goddess of love, Ishtar offered love and affections, he told her to GTFO because he was busy.
She got annoyed, so she sent the bull of heaven down to punish them. Gilgamesh and friend kill the bull of heaven, so she is mad. She kills the friend, Gilgamesh's only friend. He is great, but he is alone.
He runs around the world in anguish, looking for a solution. Is scared of dying as well.
He finds someone who became immortal. He survived because (when the God's sent a flood for the "clamouring ambition") he built an arc.
But this won't happen again the guy says, so Gilgamesh is really upset and is in despair. All the hyper-agency he has is useless.
He rebuffs love, says no to communal connection.

### Isis, Osiris, Horus

2500 BCE. Osiris and Seth were competing the head Gods. They are brothers. They up the ante, and Seth decides he's going to take Osiris down.
One version, he shows Osiris a beautiful and ornate coffin and tells him to try it. Osiris hops in and Seth suffocates him. Metaphor for frustration, lack of power.
Other version - slices up into pieces and throws into the desert.
Other version - disintegrates in the sea.

In all versions, Isis doesn't give up on him. She suffers and grieves, and finds all his pieces and reconstitutes him and resurrects him. Hovers above him and conceives Horus, the sky God.
There is a descent into despair and desperation, then a period of mourning, and then a reconstitution into a higher being.
Horus is made up of all parts except the phallus, she uses a golden dildo for that part to create Horus.
It was platonic love. Symbolic of compassionate love. Through this compassionate attention, that true power was born in Horus. They ruled together as a trinity.

Osiris is often considered lord of the dead, or lord of love. Also identified with bull. Isis has the cow horns, associated with fertility.

Balance between agency and community.

### Crete's Minoan Civilization

Trading civilization mostly. Had access to many cultures all around the Mediterranean. Have to be psychologically sophisticated enough to deal with different cultures. Saturated with symbolism of integrating the feminine with the masculine, or the community with agency.

Collapsed around 1450 BCE. These seeds of cultural sophistication were dispersed around the Greek islands are resurfaces as Greek culture.

Often female goddesses riding bulls (feminine with masculine). Priestesses were all women. Held symbols of things that were uncertain or mysteries. Like snakes or cats.

### Dionysus

Similar story (symbolically) to Osiris. Was the progeny of Zeus and Demeter/Persephone. Was illegitimate. Zeus cheated on Hera and could Dionysys. Hera was pissed so she sent the titans to cut him into pieces when he was a child. The titans came and they cut him into pieces, but before they finished, Zeus threw a lightning bolt. The only piece that survived of Dionysus survived.

Semele implanted the heart into her thigh, and he grew again (was born again). He was nurtured to life by the compassionate life.

Common people would participate in the rituals, would enact the grief for the dead Osiris, then they would descend into the tomb, then would have some kind of ritual (mystery because kept serious). Some scary parts of ritual, some communal elements, some conviction to live better lives when they emerged. Socrates/Plato believed they were very important for instilling morality in people.

Descend into the darkness, pop out 3 days later. Same with Dionysus, except more alcohol. Disenfranchised people would do this often.
Always something scary, like killing an animal, then a rave, then other stuff, then come out full of moral conviction. Mediated by female priestesses.

Dionysus is pictures as very feminine, and androgynous. Experiences his vulnerability, exists because of compassionate intervention.

### Elusinian mysteries

Greek version - very similar. Hades, Persephone, and Demeter.

Persephone (daughter of Demeter) was minding her own business, and Hades seized her into the underworld. Demeter was very upset. Symbol of platonic love. Demeter searched far and wide, never gave up, finally manages to rescue Persephone from the underworld.

Everything dies when she is down there, and everything grows again when Persephone returns.

People participated in the grief of Demeter, descended in to the cave in the side of a mountain. Stay there overnight, have a ritual, then emerge again.

### Mycenaeans: Strife in the House of Atreus

Minoan Crete collapsed around 1450 BCE.
Mycenaean Greece took over after (Sparta, war-like). Like the Iliad.

Flourished and dominated for many years, and then also collapsed, then archaic Greece began.

People think the Minoan seeds grew up again in archaic Greek culture. Much of the archaic Greek literature seems to be a tale of how not to be like the Mycenaeans, and the war culture. Almost no artwork in that period. Conquest-based civilization.

Archaic Greeks told stories about the era before them, the Mycenaeans:

Tantalus wants to be like the Gods, wants to be immortal. In an effort to make his child immortal, he cuts Pelops into pieces and serves him as food for the Gods. Disregard for communal care and hyper-agency.
His punishment is eternal frustration. He can't reach the fruit tree or drink from the pond.
The only person who ate Pelops was Demeter because she was upset about Persephone.

Pelops is somehow put back together, also has bad behaviour. Pelops' kids, Atreus do the same thing. Atreus cooked his brothers kids and taunted him with their limbs.
Complete disregard for care and community. Atreus' kids are Menelaus (King of Sparta) and Agamemnon (main general).

Trojan war began when Menelaus (king) and Helen (wife, most beautiful woman). Paris takes Helen (felinity) away to Troy. They become even more hyper-agentic.
Menelaus and Agamemnon are super angry, and go to sack Troy. It's not going well, so Agamemnon sacrifices his daughter to improve their chances. This makes his wife mad, and he is eventually killed by her.
All this strife in the house of Atreus.

Chriseis (Menelaus' concubine). He is told to give her back by the Gods. So Menelaus gives her back, and steals Achilles' sex slave, Bryseus. Now Achilles (greatest fighter) is now very angry. He decides to not fight for the Greeks anymore. Trojans are now winning, Achilles' countrymen are being slaughtered.

Achilles' mother was a flaming narcissist. Theseus has to marry a mortal, the mother. And they had half-mortal Achilles. She tried to singe off the mortal parts of him to make him fully immortal. So he is very angry at his mother, becomes hyper-agentic.

While he was away with the barge, Achilles' friend was killed (just like Gilgamesh). In his anger, he fights back and wins the battle. In the end, he dies in Troy even after they win. Too agentic.

Once he defeats Hector (other side's biggest warrior), he desecrates his body, which eventually leads to his death. Personal and social cost to hyper-agency in this family.

### The Iliad : Achilles and the Siege of Troy

Achilles was from the house of Atreus. They were callous and lacking compassion for their children, and further propagated the hyper-agency in their family. All about honour and teaching lessons.

### Odyssey

First part was the Iliad (avenge the stealing of Helen and sack Troy.) They won that battle. Second part of the story was getting home and living a long and generative healthy life.

Achilles never got home, never became wise, got truncated at a childish phase/stage. Odysseus on the other hand, was "cool" and clever, capable, like the Cretans. Capable of seeing other perspectives, and having relationships with other people. Gave him special powers to not be like Achilles.

He had the idea for the Trojan horse, was able to end the war. He could understand most people, knew they were deluded and vulnerable to flattery (Trojan horse).

The Odyssey is the story of Odysseus returning home. Childhood development and then adult development. How to live well in society as an adult.

He is really good at handling frustration, is very different from Achilles. Suffers many trials along the way of the journey, deals with the frustrations.

First one is the island, his men become distracted with the Lotus flowers, and the islanders kill some. But Odysseus forgives them (because he needed them to get home). Maintained good relationships.

Similar story with the cyclops, who has no perspective. Really nice contrast to Odysseus who is really good at taking perspective. Does the clever trick with name "Nobody". Very clever guy who sees it from both ways. They escape under sheep.

Odysseus keeps getting blown of course, representative of life's journey of suffering. Whenever he lands on a new island, he manages to maintain a relationship with people there and continually learn and grow.

Learns to be okay with uncertainty. Experiences anxiety without becoming hyper-agentic.

### Self-Knowledge: Circe and the Delphic Oracle

Odysseus ends up on an island with Circe and she turns his men into pigs. But Odysseus has already gotten the antidote, so they sleep together instead, and she turns the the pigs back to men. And she gives him tips from the future. She explains to him about the sirens, and plugging his ears.

Freud believed we need to understand this murky underworld to understand ourselves.

Odysseus goes to the underworld and sees miserable people due to hyper-agency.

Odysseus finally gets home to Ithaca, and Penelope is waiting there for him, and he manages to finish his life's course.
The home is a communal connection.  

Feminine mysterious understanding of emotions (Circe) comes up very often. The Delphic oracle is similar. Temple to Apollo in Delphi. Apollo was a God who came over from Crete (swam) with a bunch of dolphins with priestesses on their backs and brought them to Delphi (related to the word for womb). He is another feminized God.

The first thing Apollo does is visit the underworld, and exposes himself and slays a dragon. He takes one of the priestesses and installs her as the Delphic oracle. She sits in the temple and people come to her for advice. She would inhale fumes coming from the cracks in the floor and would mutter back some "wisdom" in the form of riddles. Like a zen riddle.
People tried to take symbolic meaning from these riddles.
Related to what Freud and Jung think about subconscious messages.
Over the door to the temple it said "Know Thyself" and over the other door was "Nothing in Excess". Both logical knowing and feminine, self knowing.

### Labyrinth and Minotaur

It is tempting to respond with hyper-agency but that doesn't end well.

Labyrinth of king Minos in Greece that had a minotaur (half man, half bull). Every year, 10 girls and boys from Athens were fed to the minotaur. This was king Minos' revenge because his son was killed by a bull in Athens.
Was a sad event every year.

One year, Prince Theseus decided to go. He was very brave and agentic and volunteered. His Dad told him to put a black sail on if he is dead, and white sail if he is alive, when the boat returns.

Theseus when he gets there, makes friends with Ariadne who is the daughter of Daedalus who made the maze. They are thrown into the maze (metaphor of adolescence). He is clever like Odysseus was, and puts down string to see how to get back out.

Theseus kills the minotaur. He rushes out the maze, hurries everyone to go home. Forgets about Ariadne and leaves her there, and she gets punished. Becomes hyper-agentic. Forgets to change the sail, it is a black sail. His father Ageus, kills himself (called the Aegean sea). Theseus became unbalanced and suffered a personal/social cost.

### Icarus

Similar story here. Daedalus and Icarus were put into jail when Theseus succeeded. They fashioned wings to fly out. Daedalus tells Icarus to not fly too close to the sun or the ocean, fly the middle course, nothing to excess. Icarus flies too close to the sun and melts his wings and perishes in the sea. Metaphor for hubris, hyper-agency.

### Oedipus

Was a prince. The King heard a prophecy that he was going to kill his wife the Queen, so he bound his feet and cast him away. Another family took him in.

He heard the prophecy that he was going to kill his father and marry his mother so he left his home. At a crossroads he meets the King, and kills his father the King over the right of way (metaphor). He solves the riddle of the Sphinx and is given the Kingdom and his given Jocasta, his mother, as a bride, fulfilling the prophecy.

He is filled with anguish, Jocasta kills herself, and then he blinds himself. Extremes people go to when they are faced with anxious struggles early on.

### Prometheus

Even if the hyper-agency is for a good cause, it can still backfire. Prometheus goes to the Gods and asks if he can give people fire and Zeus says no. He steals the fire and gives the fire to the humans. This hubristic challenging of the Gods causes him a lifetime of torment. Has his liver pecked out every day, and grown in overnight. Perpetual anguish over his ambition and agency.

### Aesop on pride

Pride can distort perception of pride. Socrates thought Aesop's fables were very important.

Story of the fox and the crow. We all want to think that we are great, we are deluded. The crow is deluded. The fox says "you are beautiful crow" and the crow is like "ya". And the crow had cheese in his mouth. The fox tells the crow that he must be able to sing super well, and so the crow drops the cheese and the fox takes it. How our pride can make us vulnerable to our delusions.

The fox and the grapes. "The grapes are probably sour anyway" because he can't reach them. Losing touch with reality.

The tortoise and the hare. I'm so great, I don't need to try, end up losing dramatically when we are hopped up on pride.

### Narcissus

He was very talented/skilled/good-looking. Admired himself. Echo had borderline personality disorder. Narcissus had everything about him. He ignored beautiful Echo because he was so obsessed with his reflection and eventually wasted away.

Echo couldn't generate anything of her own, could only respond to others. Ended up dying of loneliness.

Narcissus is classic example of hyper-agency.

### Course Themes

- Anxiety is a big part of human existence.
- hyper-agency is a way people try to cope with anxiety
- this comes with a personal cost
- makes people lose touch with reality and community
- Odysseus and Greek solutions are about mindfulness, balance, and communal solutions

## Week 2, Religion - Jan 12 

Religion gets a lot of press lately, a lot of it is bad, like the current extreme Islamism.

Some people agree that religion is an antisocial force.
Others say that is a prosocial force, that brings meaning to their lives.

There is a core motivational system that can drive it in either direction.

Historically, all major religions have had their dark moments. Eg. witch burnings, Crusades, inquisition.

Many "new atheists" say that religion is poisonous and everyone should forgo it.
It's a bit of a _strawman_ though - making up an example case and using it as a rationalization.

### Can Religious Beliefs Reduce revenge

Big study at York, randomly divided people, reminded them of their religious belief system (asked them). Then randomly assigned people to an anxiety experience or not. (e.g.. death, being eaten by worms)
In some studies gave them impossible tests, made them feel stupid.

When (non-religion-reminded) people are made anxious, they became more vengeful against the group that wronged them.
When religion-reminded people were made anxious, they became less vengeful.

Study with EEGs to measure brain activity. Compare brain activity of people who were highly religious versus not. Can detect anxiety with a voltage on top of the head.
Made people make a mistake during the study. Higher amplitude of neuro-marker when anxious.
People who were not religious, when they make a mistake, they had a muted anxiety response as compared to the non-religious group.

William James in 1905 wrote "The Varieties of Religious Experience". He interviewed religious converts. Their stories were filled with metaphors for energy. These are the concepts related to _Approach Motivation_. Religion seems to make people more pro-social and reduce their anxiety.

### Mindful, Communally Balanced Solutions

Odysseus was frustrated with his journey home, took 10 years, lost men, got lost at sea. Many metaphors for frustration. But he was good at being mindfully aware of the underworld, and his emotions. Had a good relationship with his men (communally balances). Because of this, he had good relationships (e.g.. with Circe, she told him about the Sirens). He wasn't like Achilles, didn't use glory to mask his distress.

Theseus had his own problems - the Minotaur. He is very heroic, and he does very well, slays the Minotaur. He is a hero! But he forgets his girl, she gets in trouble, forgets about his dad. Minotaur is a good metaphor for the passions and interests we discover in our youth.

Distress in childhood causes despair, the cycle (house of Atreus). Mycenaean Greeks were stuck in this cycle, because their femininity (Helen) was stolen.

Mindful alternatives to this hyper-agentic response.
- Knowing thy self. Knowing vulnerabilities and successes. Knowing unconscious, motives, your "underworld" versus suppressing it and overcoming it with personal agency.
- knowing the communal balance, knowing that you need people. We are social creatures, cannot thrive without the capacity to connect with other people. Primates are wired to need connection with others. Function better when we work in teams.
These two things are the antidote to this solution.

Most religious have a theme of sacrifice for other people. Religious maturity.

Goddess Isis, when Osiris was scattered and disintegrated, she mourned for him and felt his pain and did not give up on him and found his pieces and put him back together again. It was her sacrifice for him.
She transcends the distress and pain through her self-sacrifice. Her, Horace (their child), and Osiris, became powerful Gods, begun by Isis' capacity for generosity and self-sacrifice.

Many religions have a figure that personifies this capacity for compassion. People relate better to a character than to a concept. Eg. Mary in Christianity.

It's tempting to go towards lofty ideals, but you lose touch with the ground, like Icarus. Taking others' perspectives in addition to your own, is better.

Love/self-compassion leads to vulnerability and trust and hope.

Ideals are a very potent form of agency, something that transcends this world. Thinking about ideals transports people, makes them feel strong. Narcissistic ideals don't work well for people. Compassionate ideals have the power of ideals, but the ideal is about compassion. Built-in protection against getting lost in hyper-agentic world.

People participate in symbolic compassionate plays to share in pain, and overcome it. Eg. Semele, Demeter, Isis.

### Hinduism: Psychological Liberation

600 BCE.
Humans have four wants:
- pleasure. And that's okay. We are meant to like pleasure
- success. That's great. Take all the success you want, you will eventually get sick of it. Get sick of ice cream all the time, get sick of winning all the time. All that pleasure and success is hard, can get you fat, etc.
- duty, the helping other people path. Most people get sick of pleasure/success, eventually try to get on a different path, to do good for other people. Even that can get frustrating sometimes. Some people don't want to be helped.
- being. Focusing on some ideal that transcends itself. Bigger than itself. Now you are not loving for something, you are living for some moral purpose. Happens to focus on compassionate/kind/caring ideals.

_Mukti_ is this path.

Four paths, yokes, to Being.
- ideal love
- good work
- knowledge
- meditation

Last two help the mind focus on things other than the physical body, allow you to quiet the voices that tell you you need pleasure or success.

The first five steps are being moral/compassionate/caring about others, last 3 are mental steps to help avoid thinking about your needs and wants.
Although this physical world of pleasure and success exists, it is referred to as _maya_ or illusion. Associated with Shakti, consort of Shiva. Shiva, conversely, represents the opposite.
Things that grow in this world - Maya. Shiva is this passive truth principle.

Shiva, without Shakti, is nothing (Shava). Balance between the ideal world and the real world of people and things is essential for optimal human survival.

Atman is the little point of true reality that is in every person, that is part of the larger cosmic reality. But also need to be merged with this world.

Humans are broken, in order to fix it, need discipline and education from true beings.

Shiva, in this picture, has four arms. Is dancing in this world, on the fire. Dancing vigorously in it. This hand says fear not, because the other foot is above the ground, is released from this world of ignorance. My head is focused on the transcendence. "I'm in the world but not of it." Can replace the head with many figures, Isis, Persephone (stolen by Hades), Mary, Jesus, Socrates. Socrates said highest happiness came from contemplating abstract thoughts and truths - that's how transcend. Erikson breaks it into two: childish development (security, pleasure, success), adult development (identity - something to stand for/be, intimacy, generativity, integrity vs despair). Very similar themes occur in religion and in psychology.

### Buddhism: Freedom from Anxiety

Life is Duke (friction and frustration). A bad axle-hole, you have friction, it is wobbling in the hole, will have breakdowns. Life is suffering, and then we die. The reason we have this friction is because of desire (_krishna_), craving.
There is a solution, an 8-fold path. Have to yoke yourself with your ideals, they float, they are transcendent. First 5 steps are about living right, mostly related to kindness and care for others. Last 3 steps are about getting over yourself, stopping caring about mortal things. It doesn't matter that you die anymore, because you're not focused on yourself.

Strip away a lot of the ritualistic elements of religion, mostly go for the noble path. From "wandering about" to "intentional living". Don't over attach to the fruits of your goals. Stay in this world, strive in service of your ideals, but with awareness.

The middle away: don't go to extremes. They are seductive because they can pay psychological dividends in the short term but are dangerous.

Earlier forms of Buddhism often emphasized the spiritual exercises of the 8-fold path. Easier for people to focus on love and compassion (big raft vs little raft, easier for people to get on this raft). Saftas are saints of love and kindness. Worship these saints to embody their ideals themselves.

### Confucianism: Harmony

All religions began to flourish at the same time. (600 - 200 BCE). Warfare got deadly enough, people needed a better way to get along. This was happening in China after the collapse of the Chou dynasty. Chinese virtues revolve around kind interactions with others.

Doctrine of "mean between extremes". Why is extremism so tempting?

### Taoism

The gist of it is that emptiness is good. Self-assertion, hyper-agency are wrong. Humility, quietness, balance, are the important things.

### Zen Buddhism

Uni prof visits famous zen master. He sits down and the zen master starts to pour tea. The professor says there is lots to discuss. Zen master continues to pour the tea, it begins to overfill. Prof says it's overfull, and the zen master says so are you.

Sometimes considered merger between Buddhism and Taoism.
Focus on non self assertion, and compassion.

Kick the addiction to control and logic. A lot of intuitive human activity is emotional. The answers are often metaphors that the initiate would communicate to the master. Don't analyze to hard.

### Judeo-Christian tradition

The forbidden fruit came from the tree of knowledge and omniscience. Another metaphor for trying to be like the Gods. You have all of this paradise, just don't be hyper-agentic and be like the Gods.

They couldn't resist the ambition, like Prometheus. Can't be vulnerable in front of others when you are competitive.

The other tree was the tree of life. Can't be immortal and omniscient and like the Gods. Punished for trying to be like the Gods.

Then Cane and Abel. Cane gets jealous of Abel because Abel is preferred by the father. Cane kills Abel. (hyper agency, competition). Cane is sentenced to a life of wandering and despair. It's tempting to be hyper-agentic but it only leads to this kind of despair.

### Judaism: wandering, bondage, exile

- Expulsion from the garden
- Cane becomes a wandering fugitive
- flood is sent because the world is corrupt and filled with violence. All flesh is corrupted. Noah was righteous and fair, he was spared. Just like in Gilgamesh's story, the flood was sent to destroy humans because of their clamouring ambition. Here because of corruption and violence. Humans suffer because of the hyper-agency.
- tower of Babel. Build a tower into the heavens, another symbol of ambition. Punished by being confused.

The nature of this wickedness that keeps getting punished is an inability to get along with other people.

- Illustrated by the story where Abraham is visited by 3 strangers. Should be kind to strangers. Turns out they are angels, he treats them very well. He has a baby, as a gift. Next they go to Sodom and Gomorrah and Abraham's cousin is there. The Sodomites demand to come in to the cousin's cabin. He says he is being hospitable, but they keep trying to get in and "know" the strangers. He offers his daughters. They are offered femininity (kindness) and the refuse it. The word "know" is thought to be a sexual term, but could also be interrogate aggressively. Contrast to Abraham being hospitable, but Sodomites want to get something. So the Sodomites are blinded and bombed as punishment.
- Captivity in Egypt

These stories come from frustration. People respond badly to this and become hyper-agentic instead of being compassionate and kind. Social justice is important. The people who are more rewarded are those who lean more towards social justice.

### Judaism: Deliverance, Redemption

Deliverance/redemption metaphors appear often in Judaism.
- the Exodus is the freedom from bondage. Liberation/release from captivity by orienting to a righteous direction.
- not clinging to the fruits of your actions. Story of sacrifice of Isaac (by Abraham). This is the son who was a gift by the previous angels. Abraham agreed. Not clinging to things in this world.
- Jacob wrestled with God. Metaphor for grapple-y struggle to understand what's important and the underworld of murky emotions. Recurring theme of struggle and willingness to confront uncertainty. Struggle with it before one can commit themselves to a life's course. Instead of never deciding on a path, randomly choosing.
- ten commandments, focusing on commitment to God and righteousness which involves loving your neighbour. Famous statement attributed to rabbi Hillel, "Do unto others as you would have others do unto you, that is the Torah, the rest is commentary"
- mistakes are okay, as long as there is a devotion to this moral ideal.
- transcend flaws and imperfection in this world by a righteous focus.

### Christianity: Sin, Sacrifice, Salvation

Studying the bible as literature. Tricks that the authors did to emphasize certain points. Story of the rich young ruler. Lawyer goes up to Jesus and says "good teacher, what must I do to earn eternal life." Jesus asks if he follows the commandments, and he said of course. Jesus then said you have to follow me and sell all your stuff to get into heaven. The words that are used all focus on the idea that you can't earn yourself into heaven.

Before and after this story are stories about children. Emphasize being like children, get into heaven not by "earning" it but through grace.

Limiting the penchant that people have to be great.

Through self-sacrifice one can triumph through trials. Passionate personification of this kindness ideal. People participate in the passion (the sadness and despair of the people who love Jesus, and then the happiness on Easter when Jesus is resurrected). Similar to Dionysus, and Elusinian mysteries.

Yoke yourself to this ideal and you will have release from despair and burden in this life.

### Virgin Mary

People are more easily motivated by examples, characters, than ideals. So easy to identify with the compassion and love of Mary. Virginal, no pleasure, full of platonic love.

### Islam: Surrender and Peace

- Islam means peace or surrender, peace that one gets when surrenders will to God
- Mecca was hub of commercial activity for surrounding areas. Hotbed of vice and violence as cultures came together without a moral code that work across different groups.
- Mohammed was a trader. He got famous for his skill at mediating these situations.
- Recited the Quran, got chased out of town, came back, then Mecca became a Muslim town.
- he created Harmony
- similar to Confucianism
- share ideals with a compassionate theme

Mohammed revealed/purveyed how to love your neighbour. Islam is very specific about the rules of conduct and morality. Five pillars all revolve around communal connection and compassion.
One god - Allah and Mohammed is his prophet. Five times a day must pray in the direction of Mecca to remind themselves that they should be doing God's will and not their own. Should give 2.5% of net worth every year to charity.
Fast every year to remind what it's like to be vulnerable.
Pilgrimage every year
five pillars:
- creed
- prayer
- charity
- fasting
- pilgrimage.

Judaism/Christianity/Islam all incorporated Greek philosophy. The three monotheistic religions.  

### Greek philosophy

Highest happiness comes from orienting towards something more idealistic/essential/virtuous than just pleasure or success.
The idea of a true being, that is more real than this stuff. Pythagoras discovered that this perfect world of truth is useful in mathematics. Where it can actually do stuff, and music. Passionately excited.

Living according to ideals of society. Distinction between ideals and phenomena. There is the idea of a perfect triangle which doesn't exist in this world.

Aristotle focused on essences which were inside things. They are the more perfect.

Plato thought that living according to this ideals could be very useful/effective in life. Plato thought there should be philosopher kings.

Aristotle thought you should use it to live well.

### Greek virtues

#### Balance

Mean between extremes. The middle way.
- prudence (Ego) = wisdom, being in the world, not lost in some idealistic cloud. Knowing how to apply virtue in real circumstances.
- courage. fortitude to do what is necessary but not too much to be bold. Related to the Id, aggressive, sexual impulses.
- temperance, to enjoy yourself but not too much or too little
- justice. consider others as well as yourself (but not too much)

#### Virtue: taming the beast

Ego as a rational, prudent organizer. Help you get through the world in this most sensible way. The ego changed and wasn't just a disinterested organizer, began to enjoy power and self assertion. The term egomaniac. Need courage with this charioteer. Wield power but not too much. (Plato's charioteer)

The dark horse is the id (or eros). Aka libido. Requires the virtue of temperance.

The white horse has thumos (moral energy), loosely equivalent to superego. Noble desire, justice.

The challenge for humans is that we have all of these charioteers and horses, need to find balance in all of these different elements. The beginning of psychoanalysis. Anything extreme can throw off the balance of the system.

#### Virtue as Harmony

- nothing to excess
- cool Odysseus vs passionate Achilles
- Icarus should have flown the middle course
- Pythagoras about harmony and perfect proportion
- Socrates' golden mean
- Aristotle thought virtue falls between two vices, e.g.. temperance and courage.

To have virtue need to know yourself. It is really hard to know yourself because so many aspects are unconscious and murky, underworld.

We are all ignorant. Plato's cave, we are chained to our ignorance. There is more to know than we think.

## Week 3, Psychoanalysis - Jan 19

Miley Cyrus is sex and aggression personified

Freud came on the tail end of the failure of the catholic church on the quest to support humans, in the middle ages. Freud was a voracious consumer of Greek philosophy and mythology, as well as Jung (who was also into religion).

Europe was politically insecure after the middle ages. Lots of invasions, Muslim, etc. People were living in chaos and insecurity. Lots of wars and famines.

This environment gave rise to a new phenomenon. People went all in on the transcendent. Build huge cathedrals that towered to the skies, drew people’s minds away from the horrible temporal world and towards the transcendent. People focused on this stuff even though there was poverty and people living on the streets.
Gave rise to the crusades, went on for 300 years. Using religion to justify war.

A few hundred years later, Europe got even worse - black plague, half of the people died. Hundred-years war between England and France. Ice age, made famine more predominant.

A Distant Mirror by Tuchman shows how unbalanced Europe had become. There was a complete focus on transcendent glory. The church was very focused on power and glory. Could buy indulgences for the afterlife, coffins. Could volunteer for the crusades and have all your sins forgiven. Religion became a defence mechanism.
William James said that it makes the sand and grit (like dukkha) of self-hood incline disappear. Moral enthusiasm, not just religion, like what Trump spews.
Catholic church had flown too high, lost touch.

People going to the crusades bumped into Aristotle. The ignorant Muslims who were too be massacred were very knowledgeable about the Greeks. Aristotle was a proto scientist., Was interested in this world. Interest in science began again. From this renaissance (rebirth) in science and interest in this world (and not just the transcendent world). Copernicus was the first threat to human dignity at the time. People were told that the Earth was the centre of creation, but Copernicus said it was not even the centre of the solar system. Gutenberg and the printing price. Protestant revolution, Galileo, Newton (Gravity). Natural laws that don’t require a supernatural hand.
Next were Voltaire and Rousseau (enlightenment and romanticism). The enlightenment occurred in the 18th century. Gathered together lots of thoughtful people in an interest to make things better. An interest in humanism.

Rousseau wrote novels and could take a lot of meaning from human emotion. Romanticism began to replace the focus of the non-wordly realm. People became interested in their emotions and feelings.

Around that time, the Catholic church was losing its authority. Neurotic rich people were looking for a cure for their symptoms. Mesmer offered these cures. He did mystical practices, would release women from the neuroses. Mesmer said it was animal magnetism (unconscious force between people) had these psychological effects.

Casanova wrote his book about how people had unconscious desires that conflicted with their conscious thoughts. Unconscious yearnings for animal passion. This was the beginning of psychoanalysis as popular culture was getting interested with unconscious emotions, and also with relationships. The therapeutic alliance. Freud said that sexuality was the basis of all neuroses.

Mesmer made an animal magnetism tub, had groups of women come in, they would all hold onto the rails and he would do them all at once, mass healing.

### 19th Century
Freud was all about beastly passions and submitting to them. 19th century England, Queen Victoria. Seething preoccupation with sex - evident in theatre and humour.
Still this Protestant prudery. Darwin and origin species came in. Insult to human dignity - not even centre of the planet. Fuelled the fire about the importance of sexuality - it is part of our nature, we are just like the other animals.

Hypnosis, people believed there were other states beneath conscious awareness.

Charcot was interested in hysteria, unconscious psychological problems could translate into physical problems.

Industrial revolution was churning, Helmholtz was a doctor who popularized the conservation of energy - steam engine.
People living in cities, working conditions really grim. Factory workers had no life, the church had collapsed as a source of authority.
People were supposed to get meaning from their emotions but they were constantly working (anomie).

Conflict between religious ideals and temporal pleasure (worldly pleasure).
Lot of curiosity about unconscious emotions and instincts. Legitimized by the romantic movement who said this was an important part of being human.

### Sigmund Freud

Three insults to human dignity:
- Copernicus: we’re not the centre of the universe
- Darwin: we’re not the centre of the animals, earth
- Freud: we’re not the centre of our human nature, it is rather the Id. The best we can do is socialize our beastly passions

Freud began as a medical doctor doing research in a bio lab on the reproductive parts of electric eels, very phallic. He got good at experimenting on tissue with cocaine. Dabbled in cocaine, gave it to his friends. Freud suffered with anxiety and depression all his life, cocaine was great for him at first.

Theme in myth/religion: to be whole and healthy need to descend into a dark place with beasts/dragons/demons and have to face them, experience the suffering. Once you did this, then you could transcend with these communally balanced solutions. This is exactly what Freud talked about, but with unconscious. Discover things about yourself, passions, murky aspects. The part of you that you don’t want to admit. Irrational aspects. Was a prerequisite to well being and health.

Then Freud said we have to take all this bad, animal (Id) energy and transform it into something redemptive. Defence mechanism of sublimation. Want to have sex with all the people you like and kill all competitors. We will turn this urge into altruism. Indulge in loving in a more abstract way. Maturity was a defence mechanism. This was the communally balanced solution. Tried to get the superego in a way that acknowledged the other natures.

Freud was missing some scientific tools. He generated theories, it’s really easy to delude ourselves into thinking that we are right. Freud eventually lost all of his disciples, he had a very myopic view on sex. Freud was using rudimentary tools.

### Carl Jung
Was actively religious, very interested in the paranormal. Jung was way more open minded than Freud. Was a sexual philanderer. Unlike Freud was very prudish about his own life. Jung was very open to ideas about the paranormal. Lots of mental illness in his family. Lots of strange things happened in his childhood, tables breaking, etc. So he experimented with ouija boards and the supernatural.

Jung was ahead of the curve on some other things though.

The main difference between Freud and Jung is that Freud thought that Id was a receptacle for moral refuse. Main point of therapy was to acknowledge what a rascal you are, and change the shape of that so you could adjust into society. Jung had a spiritual view of the subconscious. He said that there were many archetypes that could help us grow. He thought through dreams and the unconscious you could get into your real true selves. He thought people were missing many parts of our identity. We are also a little girl, wise guru, strong beast, etc. Guidance or integrating all these parts can be had by getting in touch with the unconscious. Jung had a more optimistic view on the subconscious, unlike Freud who was very pessimistic.

### Freud’s general ideas
- Id (dark horse)
    - passionate, beast
    - wants instant gratification
    - this is what we get our energy from
    - it is desire
    - like a pitbull puppy - want to mate or bite everything
    - neurotic anxiety
    - might cause neurotic anxiety because you might think that you’re very in control, but notice these urges getting to you. perverted fantasies
    - the Id is related with two developmental stages - oral and anal, and then phallic
    - we get pleasure from these zones, and they are also related to our development
too much/not enough breastfeeding/toilet training might cause an imbalance in this part of personality
- Superego (white horse)
    - virtue, wanting to do the right thing
    - absorb this from our parents/culture
    - Freud thought men had more of this than women
    - that’s why men are moral than women!
    - Oedipal complex - men are afraid that they are going to have their penis cut off by their father because he sees son as competition for mother
    - to resolve this terror (hating dad and then being castrated) he decides to become like father, and then can win mother (or people like mother)
    - become moral to be like dad (men are moral authority)
    - moral voice
    - can have moral anxiety when you think hateful/aggressive thoughts, but think you are a good person
    - childhood sexuality = want to share good body feeling with parents
    - big crisis for kids - phallic stage
    - corresponding electra complex for women, resolved by becoming like mom
    - moral anxiety when Id carries you away
- ego (rational charioteer)
    - reality principle
    - is trying to mediate between the two
    - ego is stuck between superego, id, and reality
    - if it can’t work out a conflict, then the ego could resort to defence mechanisms
    - will repress whatever comes from the Id and push it back into the unconscious
    - common denominator of most defence mechanisms - accomplish repression
    - the problem with this is that the thoughts don’t go away, keeps threatening to come back, weird things can happen

Repression keeps the objectionable thought down by a surplus of intensity. Think of some other thought, really hard. Push the unwanted thought out of the way, mental dams.

### Freud’s Iceberg Unconscious
The ego has access to the preconscious, unconscious and the conscious. Same with the superego. Id is entirely in the unconscious.

### Psychodynamics
- instincts in animals, give rise to drives, motivational imperatives, translate into wishes and goals
    - where our energy comes from
    - life instinct drive (libido)
    - death instinct drive (Thanatos), often translated into aggression
- hydraulic theory was based on a metaphor
    - we have these 2 drives, that are like water in pipes
    - gives us energy to do things, and we have to let it out
    - if we don’t let it out, neurotic or compulsive, odd behaviours
    - sometimes you can’t let things out so you repress them with defence mechanisms
    - doesn’t help in the long term, causes a release in pressure
    - to get around this, use displacement - I have this energy, I want to tell prof he is a jerk, but I can’t say it to his face, so instead I kick my dog
    - Freud thought this catharsis was healthy. Not healthy if it is done in a bad way, antisocial
    - sublimation is how we get these nasty drives catharted in a way that doesn’t hurt anybody
    - might pick up cigar smoking, when we really crave fellatio
    - Freud was a compulsive cigar smoker
    - can become an architect and build CN tower, phallic symbol next to round symbol that opens and closes (rogers centre)
    - abstract your wishes, release the energy symbolically or socially acceptably
    - sublimate urges into creation (instead of offspring)
- Freud also said, have compassion for yourself, you are an animal, let the horse have some hay. Let yourself experience some direct sexual pleasure.

Displacement is finding a different way of releasing this energy that still somehow works. Sublimation is a form of displacement that is pro-social.

### Does Catharsis Work?
Miley, wrecking ball, about a break up.
Let teenage boys jerk off all day - “better than other things.”
Ranting after a breakup, does it make us feel better?

There are therapies that are built around this, like pillow punching.

Don Cherry has the same idea for hockey. Gotta let the boys fight. He is a Canadian redneck, is really insistent on fighting in professional hockey. They have aggressive energy, need to get it out so they don’t become savages.

There has been research on this. Researcher got word that a bunch of engineers were about to get fired. Got one group to rant, the other group explained something else. Then checked them a while later. They worked them up into a lather, they got angrier.

Trauma teams and PTSD. During shooting, disaster, emergency. Psychologists are on their way, debriefing. Whole premise is Freudian. Talk about your feelings before you repress it and you won’t get PTSD. A lot of people have studied this. Compare people who got and who didn’t get counselling. There is no effect on later well-being, but we all believe it because we are implicit Freudians. That kind of catharsis does not work, statistically.

What you really need is not just going over the material, just rumination. Need to put it into a meaningful context. Some kind of redemptive aspect.

People were asked (randomly assigned) to spend a few days writing in their diaries (4 days). Talk about life experiences. How is this related to the kind of person you are, your childhood, your relationship, your loves? Adele does this, says she is still hurting. Adele has gone into the darkness, has been mindfully aware, rises above it. Decides she’s going to love him even though he’s not going to love her. No mindful awareness in coming in like a wrecking ball.
This is catharsis, we identify with the vulnerability and the hope.

Greeks believed in catharsis, in drama because it let you vicariously move forward.

Slumdog millionaire, wins, gets the girl. These kinds of narratives are what Jung thought were the basis of psychological health. Make meaningful sense of our world that allows us to move on.

EMDR (eye movement desensitization reprocessing). This therapy is done a lot by non psychologists. Reminiscent of Mesmer. Watch the therapist's hand or a light, while you think about your problems. The theory is that the eye movement activates the two different hemispheres, causing neural integration. Talk about fears/problems/worries and then hopes/dreams/successes.

This kind of emotional catharsis only seems to work when you make meaning out of the material. Not enough just to go over the facts of the matter, need to put it in the context of life, and then can maybe see a way forward. Eg. seeing that you can be loved again after being dumped.

### Some Defence Mechanisms
Most basic kinds are denial/distraction/suppression.
A lot of guys think “she’ll come back, she’ll realize”.

Rationalization is another one, deciding you dodged a bullet, are “better off” without her. Hurt and sense of loss are still there though.

Then realizing, she’s not a basket case after all. “I hope she’s happy, she’s the best person for him, I’m happy for them”. This is the reaction formation - say the opposite to how you feel, might work if you say it loud enough.

Return of the repressed: rowdy audience member that you kick out but keeps coming back in, like the repressed thoughts. The thoughts will always eventually come back up. Might go to extremes, aggressive/sexual fixations/displacements. Some people rebound.

Projection and introjection of values:
- I feel worthless and bad, but I can’t admit that, so I’ll project that onto someone else
- like Trump projecting onto the Mexicans
- introjection: convince yourself that you are great, pull in values from someone else
- I’m an American, I’m great! Trump is like gold for defence mechanisms

### Freud, Jung, Therapy
Can’t just pull yourself up by your bootstraps. You get swamped by mystery moods, where is this coming from?

Jung thought this was one of the main misunderstandings about themselves, that people can control themselves with willpower. According to him you can’t do this unless you are familiar with your unconscious. Need to make the unconscious conscious. Wrestle with the beasts that are there, make sense of them.

Both Freud and Jung thought there were therapeutic ways to do this.

Freud thought that if you said “my neck hurts” there is some kind of neurosis there. The symptom is meaningful because there is someone in your life that is a pain in the neck. Or hip pain is a sex issue. Deep meaning into the symptoms.

Looking at what people do by accident, also at things people find funny. Freudian slips. Saying what you really man. Getting song stuck in your head, where did it come from? Often related to things going on in our lives.
Passive aggressive stuff like leaving scissors open. Accidents that aren’t really accidents. Calling girlfriend by dog’s name.

Free association: complexes around feelings and thoughts that we repressed. Whenever you put up resistance in therapy, that means you are getting somewhere important. What do the free associations skirt around, what is the common denominator. Get to the heart of the conflict. This is why Freud didn’t like hypnosis, because there was no resistance.

Freud would tell people to say something on their minds, prompted them by putting his hand on their hand. Touch used like Mesmer, touch used to release emotions. Made people feel safer.

Transference: if I feel like I have issues with my parents because I wasn’t loved properly, I have it all repressed, I have all these symptoms. This therapists is a kindly person who is there for me, this is like a parental relationships, this is safe. All these things that are suppressed (e.g.. hidden yearnings) come up again. Find yourself falling in love with therapist, is really common. Idealize the therapist. Then you discover that the therapist is just a person, and then can vilify them. People have extreme reactions with therapists, Freud thought this was very important. Now we are reenacting the conflicts that we repressed before, displace them into the therapist. Might help the client get to the root of the problem.

Dreams!

Freud thought sublimating the goal into something socially acceptable was the ultimate goal. Jung instead wanted clients to resonate with the unconscious. For Jung, the point was meaning, for Freud it was insight and then sublimation.


### Freud on Dreams
Were generally wish fulfilment. Very obvious in children, but in adults had sexual and aggressive themes. Since we repress it, it bubbles up into our dreams. A big part of therapy is having people talk about their dreams, the sexual and aggressive themes. This is the first step, can be worked through. Our superego/ego also permeate into our unconscious dreamspace.
Too threatening, even in the dream world, to let the Id out.
Have the manifest meaning - what actually happened, e.g.. chased by a bear.
Latent content, the psychological aspect. Free association around dream content and noticing where the resistance is.
Anxiety dream could be superego adding anxiety to disguise it. Or the dream is getting close to admitting true wishes, because moral anxiety in revealing true dreams.

### Jung’s Association Method
Need to have people talk about anything, also believed in association.
Say the first thing that comes to mind, when see a certain word. Jung would notice when you couldn’t come up with a word to associate with. Looked at reaction time in reply to discover complex. Look at themes that people had a hard time with. See what people are neurotic/anxious about. Jung didn’t waste dream content on association.

Jung thought dream content should be saved for the smart unconscious, for delving into this resource of meaning. Not just a receptacle for sex/aggression.

If Freud saw snake eating itself he’d say autoerotic. Also related to sex and aggression.
Jung and Freud had their first big argument about one of Jung’s dreams. He dreamed that he was exploring a house, discovered bones in the sub-cellar. Was exciting (he used to be an archeologist) because he had recently discovered archetypes. Freud thought this was death dream, that Jung wanted to kill him. Jung decided to never impose a meaning on someone else’s dream. Freud didn’t want to talk dreams with Jung anymore.

Orienting towards wholeness and meaning. Waterlily or lotus flower might symbolize nourishment from the muck, someone beautiful meaning above the surface.

Sexual dreams weren’t about other people, characters were parts of you. Trying to get in touch with your own shadow. Ugly, fierce, socially unacceptable part of ourselves. Integrate our shadow into our persona to have a more whole view of ourselves. The anima is the other symbol, like the little girl in a dream, get in touch with feminine part of self.

Must ring true for the patient for Jung. It’s about the pathway to personal wholeness and meaning.

### Jung’s Dream Examples
- Jekyll/Hyde came to author in a dream
- man had a dream about his neglected wife, she was a street person, when real wife is sophisticated and amazing, turns out this is his female side that he is neglecting
- doctor sanitized heaven, then realized there is no God. We try to sanitize our life so there is nothing murky/dangerous, but then we lose touch with our soul
- flying dream: narcissists have these. Tell you you should come back down to earth. Or might be too timid, saying “come on, fly a little”

### Jung’s Contentious Ideas
- had idea of archetypes
    - tried to explain they weren’t magical
    - hero myth about somebody who has the courage to face some kind of demon and wrestle with it and defeat it and do something good for humanity
    - this is what Apollo did, with his temple of Delphi. Slays the dragon
    - comes up independently across cultures because dragons/beasts are symbols of anxious uncertainty
    - we are vulnerable and lost, but this hero archetype tells us we can overcome it if we can face it
    - mother type, shadow type, little girl type, wise guru
    - Jung was trying to say that we have a human nature and there are things that we long for and are wired to dislike, so symbols of them come up across cultures
    - to understand human nature need to understand these symbols
- synchronicity
    - thought physical world was somehow connected to psychological experience
    - connected at some mystical/magical way
    - tables cracked, knives shattered, related to spiritual exploration in the house
    - if a bug lands from the window during therapy, it might be meaningful, what does this symbolize?
    - universe is trying to tell us something
- precognition
    - believed in dreams predicting the future
    - e.g.. dream about blood before a war

## Week 4 - Traits (Jan 26) 

### Sources of Personality

Is it more nature or nurture? Most people in this class thought nurture/both. Freud thought it was parents/nurture.

Freud thought of personality in terms of character. A function of mediation of graceful feminine presence. Can impart love and allow you to flourish. 
Intervening graceful loving figure was the mom. If she screwed up, the child would be screwed up in various ways. 

### Freud on Nurture

Oral fixation occurred at a certain stage. Around the stage when you are an infant, breastfeeding. Everything is focused on the breast. If the child doesn't get enough satisfaction, then they will feel hurt and angry and will have a fixation.

If they have too much access, they will get fixated as well. Mom has to walk a fine line to avoid her child's fixation.  

The rolling stones logo is a tongue and lips, Mick Jagger has an oral fixation. Someone might analyze him and say he has an oral fixation. Simpler solution: maybe he is just born this way.

Next big drama in child's life is toilet training. Freud thought if you were too aggressive in wanting them to get trained, the pressure would get to them. They would start to suppress it. Some kids would not go for days. Leads to anal retentive in personality. Super organized, always want everything to be perfect. 

Anal triad: stubborn, orderly, stingy (SOS) 

Maybe this is just the way they are born - born not open to experience. 

The next stage is the phallic stage. Walk around touching them and showing the genitals everywhere. Parents often freak out when the kids do this as this makes everyone uncomfortable. Kids get a shaming/extreme reaction when they notice that things feel good. Get a phallic fixation that shapes their life. Serial lovers. Compensate by becoming powerful to influence and win over other people. Superiority complex. Could also just be traits that are intrinsic to the person. More parsimonious explanation. 

The genital station is when you get past your own erogenous zones and start caring about other people's genitals. Start caring about other people's enjoyment/orgasms. Sublimate that to charity and giving back to others.

All of these fixations can either come from too much or not enough of the stage's key elements. 

### Mick Jagger

Grew up in a suburban town in England. Went to the London school of economics for a year and then dropped out to start a band. They were having fun, got famous. Got arrested on drug charges, eventually this guitarist Brian Jones dies of drugs. This is Mick's Gilgamesh moment. Has a free concert for his friend.

Later have a concert where someone at the concert tried to rush the stage and got stabbed. Mick felt responsible. They had just finished playing "sympathy for the devil" so he got the reputation for being dark/satanic/murderous.

This is the time that lots of people were dying (Jimi Hendrix, etc.) Lots of 27 club members. Instead, Mick Jagger stayed alive, stayed friends with Keith Richards (smack addict). They've been together almost 50 years.

Mick Jagger is like Odysseus - he is able to continue relationships despite repeated frustrations. He is in touch with his feminine side, often wears makeup, prances around.

Also in touch with his murky emotional side. "Jumping jack flash" was about a guy who had a bunch of adversity and triumphed over it. Mick identified with being a survivor. Knew about his feminine side, his dark side. 

Was part of the "sex is okay" revolution. Prototypical hero. Descended into the darkness (acid trips, etc) then comes back with a heroic gift for humanity (have lots of sex was his message). 

Might say that he was hyper-agentic. Keith Richards says he is an ego-maniac and his hard to be around. Perhaps his anxious experiences in the phallic/oral stage made him this way. 

### Was Freud Scientific?

Generalized from his own life to the broader sense.

Didn't really define his terms, what exactly is an oral fixation? When the terms are fuzzy, it can make anything fit the conclusion. For good science need to define the criteria beforehand, otherwise unfalsifiable.

Similarly resistance is hard to falsify. 

Want the study facilitator to not be invested in the theory (like Freud was). Unbiased and blind.

### Projective tests: Assumption

Thematic episectoin test. Tell what you think is happening in a picture, this leads insight into the person's personality. Scientists defined manuals to more precisely follow scientific methods.

### Murray

Was a medical doctor, wanted to make it more scientific. His theory was that people have these unconscious biological needs.

The environment also primes these needs. Called "press". If you have a combination of a need and a press, then you have motivation.

Need for aggression, then go to a boxing match (press) this will give you a primed aggressive motivation.

Need for nurturing, then go to therapy, then you will well up with motivation to be cared for which is where transference comes from.

Same psychoanalytic assumptions that people will be unwilling to report certain things - need to access them with projective tests to find out what people are thinking underneath it all. 

We might have different results on projective tests from day to day, this is because the press may not be there every day.

Main problems is that the tests are not reliable, cannot predict anything. 

Research on this is almost dead, except for a few people who coined the "Self-Determination Theory". Motivational theory that people have 3 main needs:

- relatedness: capacity to give and receive love
- competence: be effective in goals
- autonomy: being able to make choices

Murray had 27 needs in contrast.
They say that if you are able to express these needs, will have intrinsic motivation. Without these, will be depressed and low. 

People who have these capacities have better facets of their life (academics, well-being, relationships, etc).

This is the last branch of this motivational tree that Murray began in his attempt to make Freud's ideas more scientifically defined. 

### From Motives to Traits

Freud's theories eventually went out of style. Academics started seeing psychoanalysis in bad ways, the assumption was questionable: is personality really all about sexuality?

The cognitive revolution was that people actually said what they meant. If you want to know something about someone, just ask someone - they might tell you.

Personality is less about character/virtue/extremes. 

Murray wrote his book in 1938, his colleague Gordon Allport released his in 1937. Allport decided to keep it simple. Went to see Freud, saw a really unkempt kid on the bus. During an awkward encounter with Freud, he made small talk about this boy, and Freud said that he saw himself as the boy. Turns out Allport was actually a neat freak. Allport vowed to himself that he wouldn't go down this rabbit hole and keep his theories more simple. Asks people about their personalities.

He collected 4500 trait adjectives in English and thought of these as personality traits. 

A __personality trait__ is used to describe a person's tendencies across time and context. Traits fall along the normal curve - average traits have the most number of people. 

Focused on test-retest reliability. Also internal consistency reliability (if they say they are funny, they will also say they make people laugh). 

### Personality Psychology

1960s zeitgeist was really in favour of social psychology. Times were changing. 

Millgram study (prison study) showed the power of the situation. Personality was the poor cousin that people weren't that fond of.

Some of the nazi scientists were doing eugenics research to see if certain personalities were heritable, the research naturally got a bad reputation.

Walter Mischel reviewed the literature and he thought that personality traits were distateless, and they also couldn't predict things in the real world. Social psychology predicts things, but the personality scale doesn't predict anything reliably. 

The big 5 traits organization came out in the 80s. Became a common language for psychologists to agree on. They were stable across time and context (basic personality traits). Not necessarily that you are funny because of the people around you. These big 5 will persist across time and context. Also there was a degree of heritability. 

### Big-5

Computers allowed for factor analyses. Catell had people rate themselves on the 4500, did factor analysis and got 12 traits. 

Then Fiske boiled it down to 1700 adjectives, which clumped into 5 clusters. Other researchers replicated the results among other cultures/languages/ages/non-verbal methods.

Could predict real things with these, like politics and divorce.

#### Factor analysis

Run correlations, factor each adjective to see how well it fits into a group. Boils them down. People stay in the same rank of personality traits as they go through life. Women are at peak neurotism in their 20s, goes down later in life. 

The Big Five (a-theoretical approach):

- openness: intellectual, complex, unconventional, creative, original (MORE)
- conscientiousness: dependable, disciplined, organized, careful (MORE)
- extraversion: enthusiastic, outgoing, talkative (AVERAGE)
- agreeableness: sympathetic, warm accepting, friendly (LESS)
- neuroticism: anxious, easily upset, moody (AVERAGE)

These weren't generated very scientifically, just seeing which adjectives stick together. 

### Meyer's Briggs Test

Jung thought people were born with individual differences, he theorized some traits. He thought some people were either extraverted or introverted, intuiting or sensing, feeling or thinking, judging or perceiving. 

Jung thought that people were born with traits that were either inward or outward focus of attention. (Extraversion)

Sensing vs intuiting mode of perception. Some people are more abstract, in the world of ideas, others like to use their concrete senses. People that are highly open are also usually highly intuitive. 

Feeling vs thinking, how you make decisions. 

Perceiving vs judging. Whether you like to get more information (see what we think later) or just deciding right away. 

Jung had an elaborate theory for how these modes interacted together. 

Meyers briggs measures four of the big five. This scale is incredibly popular. Less pejorative, nicer terms, no neuroticism measured. All of the traits are "nice." It makes everybody "beautiful in their own way." 

Strong genetic contribution to these traits. 

### Types are inaccurate

Dichotomizing is not how traits work, they exist on a continuum. Most people are in the middle. 

### Personality Genetics

What accounts for the variability in traits? 

- shared environments (usually lingo for parents/nurture)
- heritability (genes/nature)
- other
    - unique experiences
    - culture
    - social norms
    - womb/birth
    - measurement error


### Genetic Similarity

Twin studies try to eliminate the shared environment aspect. Siblings and non-identical twins are 50% similar. Identical twins share 100% of genetic material. 

They are studies by looking at pairs of siblings. Compare the correlation between non identical siblings and identical sibling pairs. 

Adopted parents and kids: might think they'd adopt their parents personalities. Turns out 0 correlation.

Adopted siblings: 0 on average. No more different than completely random people. Maybe it is because adoptive parents act in a certain way.

Biological kids and parents: 0.1 - very low correlation. 

Biological siblings: 0.1 - very low correlation.

Non-identical twins: 0.25, still not very high

Identical twins: 0.5 

Identical twins raised apart: (separate them at birth and raise them differently) 0.5

Looks like parenting does not affect normal personality. 

### Heritability Estimates

(correlation for identical twins - correlation for siblings) * 2 * 100% = % of variance hereditary

About 50% for most traits

### Where's the other 50% (or 30%)

Shared environment has no effect. 

Maybe it is due to measurement error, multiple raters boost heredity to 70%.

Perhaps environment isn't really shared - parents treat kids differently. 

Harris: maybe it is evolutionarily advantageous for the parent to not influence their child's personality - they don't procreate with their parents. 

Change is possible, genetic predisposition is not absolute destiny. 

### Heritability

- height - 0.9, but environment can affect this (e.g.. malnourishment)
- weight - 0.5, some people overcome this with willpower
- marriage - 0.68, heritability of staying married. That's pretty high! You can still divorce the person, but these traits make them inclined to stay with the person. 

Heritability estimates can't be applied to a single person. 

Heritability does not mean constant or fixed:

- people are getting taller over time
- people are getting smarter
- heavier

but the predisposition to these things is hereditary. 

### Personality changes

People generally get better over age:

- more introverted
- less open
- more agreeable
- more conscientious
- less neurotic

Lifestyle factors can change personality:

- leaving home
- marriage/divorce/death of a family member
- career/retirement
- becoming a parent
- therapy

### Line bisection exercise

Guess where the halves are in a piece of paper, then fold it to find the exact. Some people err on the side of the left, others on the right.

So right tickers have more left brain activity (not sure if this is what he said)

### Traits and divorce

Divorce is highly heritable, how is this?

What if identical twin and parents got divorced? 80% divorced

What if identical twin and parents stayed married? 10% divorced

People who are open to experience are more likely to get divorced. Novelty is interesting

Consciousness is inverse to divorce. 

Neurotic people are more likely to get divorced.

Extraverts (active and social, going out, meet people) more divorce. 

Agreeableness has no relationship with divorce. 

high E, high O, low C, high N, 4 = 0.4
Traits also predict the identical twins likelihood of divorce the same way. (don't need their own traits)
Completely ignores the partner's traits. 

Heritable traits predict propensity towards divorce. 

### Trait correlations with major life goals

- E and C want to make a lot of money (-o, -A)
- Career and graduate school (C)
- aesthetics - O
- Social welfare (A)
- relationships and children (E)
- Political influence (E)
- fun and excitement (E)
- personal growth (O)
- traditional marriage (-O)

### Traits and Attitudes

- crossword puzzles (70% correlation)
- immigration
- euthanasia
- abortion
- racial discrimination (74%)
- organized religion (44%)

### Openness to experience

- aesthetics
- fantasy
- novelty
- values
- actions
- feelings
- ideals

highly open people are really excited about sex and trying new things. Less open people like to try new things less.

Politics: there is the great divide. High open (democrats) vs low open (republicans). 

Conservative religion vs modern religion. 

Open people tend to marry open people. All the other traits are pretty random in marriage, but openness as a strong correlation. 

### Are you better or worse than average?

Most people think they are better.

## Week 5 - Biology (Feb 2)

### Big-5

There was a lot of care taken to ensure that the big-5 traits were independent. But for the last 15-20 years, it turns out the 5 traits are actually not independent. 

Extraversion and agreeableness are independent.

Neouriticism and low agreeable are dependent.

Neuroticism and conscientiousness are correlated. Neurotic people less conscientious. 

These go together to form _meta-traits_. 

### Meta-traits

Neurotic, low agreeable, low consciousness is the anxiety meta trait. This is new research. 

Extraversion and openness are the approach meta trait. Plasticity trait, receptive and responsive to perturbations in the environment. Eagerly oriented towards change. 

Some people measure how often you smile. Focus on these top two levels though.

#### Anxiety

This system is good at detecting obstacles/frustrations/uncertainties. It is a very useful tool to tell us when something needs to be avoided/changed. Very important in some environments. 

- Hesitation
- negativity
- vigilance
- bad feelings (N)
- social distrust (A)
- motivational instability (C) 

#### Approach

- Eagerness
- hope
- inspiration
- exploration
- it is absorbing. When the approach system is on, it helps you stay committed to a goal that is going well. 
- useful during hunting - don't get distracted, stay confident
- energetically pursue goals and social contact (E)
- diverse concrete and abstract incentives (O)

### Facets of Big 5 traits

#### Neurotic

- __anxiety__
- depression. very highly correlated with anxiety. Can't stay anxious for long without getting depressed
- vulnerability. Become vigilant, negative when anxious. More likely to see negative stuff, makes you vulnerable
- self-consciousness
- impulsiveness
- angry hostility

All of these lead to a negative overarching state. Theoretically you shouldn't be impulsive during anxiety, but because you have a negative state they cause this.

One way to get out of an anxious state is to find something to approach. People who are feeling vulnerable/self-conscious/depressed, they have few goals. Things that they can approach are impulsiveness. 

Approach system can be improved through impulsiveness/hostility. Anger is an approach-motivated emotion. Need to get towards someone to yell at them. 

#### Disagreeable

- not trusting, cynical
    - unlikely to see the positive side
- not straightforward secrets, elusive
- non compliant, uncooperative
- not altruistic, selfish
- not tender-minded, callous
- not modest, arrogant
    - all the previous are vulnerable
    - being arrogant and not modest doesn't make sense
    - but everybody hates people who are arrogant
    - disagreeable people don't mind
    - positive self-ideal activated the approach system

If you are disagreeable, most of your goals/tasks in life will be difficult.

#### Unconscientiousness

- low self discipline
- low deliberation, thoughtless
- unreliable, not dutiful
- low achieving, careless
- low order, disorganized
- low competence, failure

Many caused because you are so focused with dealing with possible dangers.

The first 2 are interesting though, low level accessible ways for anybody to get out of an anxious meta-trait state. 

#### Extraversion

- approach rewards/excitement
- positive emotions
- assertiveness
- activity
- gregariousness
- warmth

Often moving towards other people. Smiling, enjoying other people. The more action based aspects of approach, openness is the more cognitive aspect.

#### Open

- actions
- imagination, fantasy
- feelings
- ideas
- values
- aesthetics

Let the mind wander freely without anxiety. Highly open people want to try new things. 

### Anxiety and Approach Processes

Pavlov began his research before Freud. First noticed that 2 kinds of dogs. One very anxious type, other extraverted. Excitatory and inhibitory dogs. Excitatory dogs expecting rewards, other dogs scanning for troubles. 

Eysenck was very prominent. He has the big 2: neuroticism and extraversion. Lots of studies showing that neurotics don't want negative things to happen (make mistakes). Extraverts go for speed - don't care so much about mistakes. (In tests)
Did the first twin study, 40 years before others. Concluded that personality traits were highly heritable.

Gray (Eysenck's student) studied rats' personalities. Found 2 systems: BIS (behavioural inhibition system) and BAS (activation). 
He is the theorist who discussed how the two systems interact. The two systems are reciprocal. 

DeYoung split into instability vs plasticity.

In his lab, trying to find neural signatures of the activity of these two system. ACC (anterior cingulate cortex) top of the brain registers when goals are not going well. Reliable negative voltage deflection. Magnitude of this reflects the magnitude of anxiety. 
Left frontal is more active during approach motivation - eager states. 

Neurotransmitters - low serotonin predicts high activity in anxiety. High dopamine predicts high activity of the approach system. 

Are anxiety and approach processes related? Reciprocally inhibitory? Gray's student revised his theory. Widely accepted that these 2 symptoms are reciprocally inhibitory. High approach system dampens the anxious system. At a trait level, can be high or low in both.
Recent study that looked at people's brain activation looked at left frontal vs right frontal brain activity. Made people make errors in the lab, measured anxiety response (ACC). Found that approach motivation seemed to be associated with muted error negativity. Anxious people had a higher response. 

ACC detects survival relevant information, feeds forward to neocortical part of brain to act on the information. 
"Uh oh" detection and correction system. Important to have this to correct problems. This is the dukkha system (not getting what is wanted). 

### Anxiety and BIS

ERN is a very quick marker of anxiety related symptoms. Other symptoms of anxiety in the behavioural inhibition system. 

When this anxiety system is triggered, automatic suppression of goal-related activities. Animals actually stop in their tracks. Something isn't going well, need to stop what you're doing. 

Anxiety to discourage persistence in what you're doing.

Vigilance to scan for alternatives. 

Arousal and readiness for action (cortisol). Something isn't going well, stop and reassess. 

If you drug this system with alcohol, you don't notice or mind errors too much. Lubricates social events because no longer worried with small things. If you take an animal and cut this part of their brain out (lesion it) they end up like bart Simpson, can no longer get around obstacles. 

### Goal Regulation

Approaching your goals in the morning when you get up. When hungry, start foraging for food.

Mouse wants to get food, smells cat. Want food, smell predator. This is an approach-avoidance conflict. Simultaneous activation of approach and withdrawal system. Don't see a cat, still approach food, but have anxious vigilance. Will keep foraging, look around for the cat. 
The mouse might get to a place where they don't smell the cat anymore, then resume eager absorption without distractions. This is an adaptive process of behavioural inhibition system. 
The problem comes when you can't escape. Like when you're a human and you're aware that you're going to die. Will never lose this "Scent", so how can you lose this anxiety. 
This system evolved before new evolutionary problems, like contemplating death. This anxiety system keeps on festering, pumping out cortisol, makes you unhealthy and depressed. 

### Approach, Anxiety and Left Frontal Asymmetry

Clinical studies on humans with lesions. Strokes that affect each side. Other side wins if one side is down.

People with right side lesions (left side active) tend to be happy/hopeful but a little shallow. 

People with left lesions, they are more moody/sad/unstable. Takes away the approach motivation. Since they are reciprocal, makes the anxiety system more dominant. 

Left frontal asymmetry comes from "wanting". Occurs when you put sugar on a baby's tongue.

Power, commitment, anger can activate left frontal asymmetry. 

We also approach abstract things, ideals, values, meaning. Approach these things, the kind of person you want to be.

Certainty, conviction, rationalization also approach motivated. "I didn't want it anyway." Freudian defence mechanisms - approach system down-regulating the other system. Anxious people often do non-anxious things. 

Phineas Gage: got a pike through his head, went through his left frontal lobe. He was nice before this, he became profane/rude/impulsive/fitful/impatient after. Animal passions prevailed. 

Just left the anxious part of his brain (BIS prevailed). 

### Line bisection activity

Left brain active, see more stuff in right visual field (not sure, wasn't paying much attention). 

- left brain activity, right visual field prominent. 
- more prominent right visual field makes it seem wider
- rightward bisections
- then check with thumb/finger
- extraversion linked to approach, if extraverted then should be right-ticker. 

Correlations between right ticking and EEGs. r = 0.38
More left frontal activity, more tendency to tick to the right

Approach motivation: purpose

- makes you feel calm, eager
- absorbed

### Brain damage

Need to have the other system for safety. Uh-oh system to notice dangers. Some people with brain damage only have one system active. 

Right hemisphere stroke, left frontal dominant. This makes their commitment/engagement system more active, anxiety less active. 

Sometimes have left arm paralysis if the damage extends into the motor area. 

Ramachandran did a study on patients with left hemisphere stroke and left arm paralysis. Deny that their arm is paralyzed. 
Ask them:

- can you use your right/left hand
- are both hands equally strong
- point to nose with left and right hand

During left hand non-movement, they say they are pointing to the nose when they are not. Sounds like a Freudian defence mechanism. 

Ask them if they can clap as well, say they are clapping.

Make excuses/rationalize why they can't do it.

5 to screw in a lightbulb, 10 to tie shoelaces. They choose shoelaces, then claim to have done it successfully. No frustration in failure, they are in complete denial.

Give them a tray, it falls completely. 

If you take a syringe of ice cold water and flush their left ear canal with it. This awakens the right hemisphere. Ask them again about the arm, they know that is paralyzed, and that it has been paralyzed for a while.

90 minutes later back to the old behaviour.

When the anxiety system is knocked out, the approach system can run amuck. 

### Aggression, Anxiety, Cortisol

Cortisol is adaptive, short term. The body is ready for action. In the long term, is unhealthy. Suppresses the immune system, leads to depression. 

Aggressive hyperactivity predicts low cortisol. Low anxiety response. One possible explanation is that engaging the approach system is a defence against this. 

Sociopathic types free themselves from anxiety by becoming so committed to their aggressive ways. Also possible that people with low anxiety people don't care about the consequences and become sociopathic in response. 

Reactive approach motivation: when people are anxious, they don't just become aggressive, they spontaneously lunge towards whatever goal is salient for them. Go for it with increased tenaciousness - mutes anxious distress. Religion, chocolate, goals, etc.

### Nature and nurture of traits

Genes code for neurotransmitters and hormones affect brain function and laterality.

Environment has a reward history. Non-shared family environment. Habits.

All of these can also affect brain function leading to personality traits. 

### Neurotransmitters for Anxiety and Approach

- Serotonin for anxiety
- dopamine for approach

SSRIs act on serotonin receptors that are intimately linked with anxiety and depression.

Dopamine and associated neurons are specialized for the approach system. Cocaine also acts on these neurons. To get a rough idea of high activity of approach system, try cocaine. Grandiose, eager. 

### Serotonin Molecular Genetics

One gene codes for one protein.

5HT(serotonin). 5HTT (serotonin transporter) gene has several alleles. Can also be called polymorphism, many forms. Same gene, many versions. There is the original gene, by mutation, some of it gets taken away. The half left can still create the protein but less stuff. Or it gets doubled or tripled.

Still creates the protein, but it may get weird. 

The gene is necessary for efficient functioning of the serotonin neurons. Helps transport serotonin across the synapse (between axon and dendrite of to serotoneurgic neurons)

Short version functions less well than the long version of the allele. 

Since serotonin is linked with anxiety, people with a short version should maybe be more susceptible to anxiety and depression in their lives. 

Asked people how many stressful life events they have had. (e.g. death of a family member, marital breakdown, losing a job)

Also analyzed genetic material, see SS or SL or LL. Found that SS people were much more likely to have depression if more stressful events. If non-stressful events then same odds as LL people. SS people with stressful life have a 0.4 chance of getting depressed. Diathesis stress model.
Serotonin is necessary for coping with stress (a well functioning serotonin system).

Other researchers found that people with SS alleles when put into an fMRI machine, found that their amygdala (scans for emotionally relevant stuff, think of it as Id) are especially more reactive to negative stuff. Their amygdala's focus more on bad stuff.

Rhesus Macaques are the nastiest of macaques. Constantly pushing each other around. They will constantly vie for the alpha positions. 
Article looked at their genes. Genes that code for serotonin efficiency. These macaques had the highest likelihood for more anxious allele connections. Even in other primates,  there is the same tendency to be more reactive with a suboptimal serotonin system.

All of these finding are less certain than they seem in textbooks. 

### Neuroticism and the Brain

Central anxiety related trait. We don't think about anxiety as the right side.

Left frontal goes well with approach, but right frontal and anxiety is less reliable. Doesn't always correlate - ERN is a better metric. 

If you confront people with threats, e.g. failure, does cause an immediate spike in right frontal EEG. Sometimes these threats make people feel more depressed.

Study also linked ERN to neuroticism. Measured big-5 than confronted people with uncertainty, which is especially noxious to neuroticism. Approach-anxiety conflict is the essence of neuroticism. 

Neurotics exposed to uncertainty produces highest ERN. 

The serotonin transporter gene (5HTT) has inefficient short version - S, and efficient - L. People with SS have a higher amplitude of the ERN response. 

Amygdala is more thread selective with the SS alleles. Tracks motivationally relevant stimuli. Some people's amygdala's are more focused on opportunities and good things.

First line of defence against anxiety/depression is SSRIs, prozac. Serotonin closely linked to neuroticism. 

### Unconscientioussness and the Brain

People who are anxious should be particularly careful, but they are surprisingly not. Conscientiousness is self control, controlling impulses. 

OCD (low impulse control - thoughts can't control, then do the obsessive behaviours that can't control). People with OCD also have high amplitude ACC-ERN responses. 

Low serotonin is linked to impulsivity. 

OCD related to SS alleles for 5HTT

People prescribe SSRIs for OCD. 

The OCD cycle:

- obsessive thoughts 
- engage in compulsions (give some relief)
- only short term, then back to the obsession again

Compulsions activate the approach system, temporarily down regulate the anxious system, but only temporary because not fulfilling goals.

### Oxytocin - trust hormone

Another area of research where the confidence rating is low. Occasional failures to replicate. 

This the feeling after sex is an oxytocin experience. Human touch releases oxytocin, breastfeeding, sex. Bonding hormone makes people trust/like others, facilitates social interactions. 

In the animal kingdom, humans and prairie voles have lots of oxytocin. Prairie voles pair up, males stay together to raise their pups. 

Bonobos have high oxytocin levels. Constant orgy. Very low anxiety/aggression. Bonobos are our closest genetic relatives. 

### Agreeableness and the brain

Serotonin agonists increases oxytocin.

Oxytocin reduces ERN. 

Reduces social threats, lets people trust others more. Trust games. 

Amygdala becomes less reactive to social threats after oxytocin. 

Can but "liquid trust" vials. One study with a bunch of people with borderline personality disorder - have antisocial phases. Gave them oxytocin, but it actually made them worse. When people get some influence into their system that is highly unusual it can cause anxiety. It is definitely not a cure-all. 

### Personality Across the lifespan

Other evidence of these traits comes from developmental trajectories across time.

Over a million people, looked at various ages, average levels of certain traits.

Traits (3 anxiety traits) tend to change around the same times, suggesting that similar hormones/neurotransmitter processes may be responsible for the same changes.

Women have a puberty spike for neuroticism, then it gets better. Men don't have a spike, they have a dip. Maybe it's because of male gender roles. Maybe there is a spike in testosterone during young adulthood (activate approach system and suppress anxiety).

Dip in conscientiousness in early adulthood, then goes up for rest of people's lives. 

Agreeableness drops in teenage years, but then rebounds as well. 

### Dopamine and approach

High concentrations of dopamine around the incentive and reward centre of the limbic system. Also the left frontal cortex - the thinking part of the brain. The conceptual approach and also the concrete animal approach both mediates by dopaminergic neurons. 

For synapses to work, the synaptic cleft needs to be cleared before next transmission.

For good transmission need:

- good receivers to catch transmitter
- good enzymes for breaking down transmitter and reuptaking them for reuse 

Dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) is like the serotonin transporter. Helps transport the leftover neurotransmitter back into the axon for reuse. This receptor is a protein, coded for DRD4 gene. 

4 repeat allele (normal), 7 repeat mutation. 

People with the 7 repeat have link to novelty/sensation seeking. Problems with dopamine/wanting, they are impulsive in sensation seeking. 
ADHD is linked to two copies of this 7 repeat allele. When the approach system is not functioning properly, people have a hard time suppressing desires. 

### MAO and molecular genetics

MAO collects and breakdowns the used neurotransmitter in both dopamine and serotonin synapses. 

There is a gene that codes for this enzyme. Doesn't create enzymes that work as well (bad allele)

People with this allele are more likely to have conduct disorders, especially if they are in stressful environments. Gene-environment interaction.

Aggression/sensation seeking are both approach motivated. 

### Amygdala: Attention to + and - cues

fMRI study, sends magnetic (highly) impulses into brain that interact with oxygen molecules and make them visible to a scanner. Where there is more oxygen, there is more blood.

If a big Blood Oxygen Level Dependant (BOLD) response, that is a higher activity location in the brain. 

A study correlated extraversion scores with amygdala responses to happy/unhappy stimuli. The amygdala is like the Id, notices things that are creature-ly good/bad. I could mate with that, that could eat me.

Extraverted people are focused on incentives, approaching possible positives. They found that people with higher extraversion scores had higher BOLD responses after seeing happy scenes. They were extra motivated by seeing happy scenes. Their amygdala is scanning for happy things. Also showing happy faces or fearful faces (social cues). 

Happy scene correlation was 0.79 for extraverts

Fearful faces, 0.2 correlation

Happy faces, 0.71 correlation

Extravert brains are scanning for positive opportunities. 

### Openness and the brain

Dopamine increases the appeal of novelty. Very left prefrontal cortex.

Cognitive component of approach. Engaged by thinking of new possibilities.

Schizophrenia - very open to new possibilities, not constrained by reality. These people have very extreme dopamine receptors. 

### Extraversion and the brain

Dopamine is the concrete/more active version of openness. 

Cocaine mediated by dopamine receptors. 

Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is very related to the approach meta-trait. (oxytocin is a hormone)

Testosterone also increases extraversion, inhibits fear (amygdala).

A big biological contributor to testosterone is having a Y chromosome. Men have way more than women. Why is testosterone related to extraversion/approach?

A study took girls/boys into lab and asked them what they do if they are playing and someone takes their favourite toy. Coded the responses for aggression (chase, hit) versus passive (cry, tell the teacher, be sad). Boys had more of the active responses. Maybe this is because of gender roles, socialization. When fetus' brains are changing in-utero, in the sensitive period when the fetus is becoming male/female. What if during this time, pregnant women are given testosterone analogues. They found women who had this. Brought these kids into the lab, asked them the same question.
Both boys and girls exposed to more testosterone produced more active responses to provocation. 

Another study asked about toy preferences. Kids came into a toy heaven, let them choose the toys they want and do whatever they want. Coded whether the toys were active (guns, cars, weapons, balls, things that move) or passive (dolls, pens, art). Noticed same - boys more likely to choose boy toys. Socialization argument also works here too,

Took similar kids who had been exposed to more testosterone in utero (due to conditions/medication), found that the girls had the same preference for boy toys as the boys.

Biological basis (through testosterone) for male preferences for approach related activities. 

### Finger lengths (2D:4D)

On average, men have a longer 4th digit than 2nd. Higher testosterone levels correlated with longer 4th digit. 

<a name="week6"></a>
## Week 6 - Desire (Feb 9)

Suppression of aggressive reactions to frustrations activates the BIS system, until you need to relieve it somehow, and aggression is an approach motivated relief, activates the BAS and downregulates the BIS. It's all about mood regulation. 

### Experiential Results

- Approach factor
    - BAS
    - extraversion
    - narcissism
    - hypomania
- anxiety factor
    - neuroticism
    - BIS
    - low self-control
    - uncertainty
    - aversion

- anger and hostility
    - related to both
    - anxiety makes people want to escape from it, by doing something angry/hostile
- rumination
    - correlated negatively with approach, positively with anxiety
- self-control
    - positive with approach, negative with anxiety

- efficacy -> happiness
- integrity -> meaning
    - meaning/integrity is more pronounced in older adults
    - define themselves by doing well
    - efficacy no longer predicts well being among senior manager

- emotional intelligence (mind in eyes)
    - people low on narcissm, low on approach, low on anger, high on mindfulness were good at this

### OSCAR - Approach Avoidance

- never went outside, spent the whole day at the window looking to get outside
- for 5 years
- one day, Oscar lept over Ian's leg and went to the front yard
- what did he do when gets there? fulfills his life goal
- he gets there and he becomes very anxious and hides under the porch
- stays there for half an hour
- approach avoidance conflict
- activates the BIS, become vigilant, feel anxiety
- can't think of anyway to resolve this, so he withdrew

### Hector - Approach Approach

- While he gets his food, Ian goes to the door and gets the chain 
- gets food once a day, goes for a walk once a day
- now he doesn't know what to approach more
- runs to the door, then runs back to the food
- goes back and forth
- approaching one means losing the other
- eventually stopped right in the middle and had a fit, which accomplishes nothing
- temper tantrum is activating the approach system

### How do people respond to threat?

- BIS functions to resolve approach-withdrawal conflict
- approach-oriented resolution: persist in goal activity (howling for hector resolved his anxiety)
- withdrawal-oriented resolution: give up on goal


### Goal theory

Pavlov, around the same time as Freud, talked about different kinds of dogs - excitatory and inhibitory.

### Pavlov

Classical conditioning. After his nobel, started looking at dog personality and dog conflict. 

Goal conflict caused distress and dog tantrums.

He put his dogs into conflict situations:

- trained them that when they saw a circle they would get a reward
- started showing ovals, dogs weren't sure what it was, started going berserk
- also shocked dogs in the leg, and moved it down farther. It was a painful shock, but the reward was gravy so dogs still expectantly did it. Since he was moving it down, they weren't sure if they were approaching food or approaching a shock. At some crossover point the dogs would throw tantrums.

### Lewin

Wanted to become more scientific with Freud's ideas.

Worked with toddlers, go them to walk backwards towards a rock. They want to succeed at the goal. When you get there, need to look between the legs and sit on it. At some point to sit, need to take eyes off it. They wanted to please the person, but avoid falling, they would throw a tantrum. 

### Definition of a Goal

- not merely a stimulus and a response
- is the combination of a stimulus and a motivational behavioural orientation to respond by approaching/avoiding that stimulus
- rats do not learn responses, they learn goals
- block their original response to a stimulus, they will adopt a new means of achieving the same goal
- goals are fluid thing that don't have to happen in the exact same way that we intend

### Happiness of Pursuit, Discrepancy Reduction

- regardless of whether the goals are un/conscious, they tend to operate according to a certain process
- we have a goal
- compared to comparator (want to kick somebody, haven't kicked anybody)
- discrepancy generates output (find someone to kick)
- repeat cycle for discrepancy reduction
- discrepancy reduction is the key to well-being
- goal shielding, absorption, engagement, flow
- become absorbed in the goal, other things become less salient
- feel very engaged
- lose track of time
- obstacles -> anxious effort -> disengagement
- if the goal is blocked for a long time, will eventually disengage

### Automatic goals

- crossword puzzle with goal primes (achieve, compete, succeed, strive, attain, master)
- one with other primes (loved, support, affection, accepted)
- the goal primed ones are more likely to be sore losers
- the other ones give more to charity
- we are much more automatic/less in-control than we think
- non-conscious goals that can be primed with unconscious contanct with billboards or something
- eg. might cheat more after seeing nike billboards

- automacity of everyday life
- show people pictures of guns in a lab, then when you bring them into the lab in a Millgram like experiment, shocking them when their student gets something wrong, give more aggressive shocks
- if primed with words related to rudeness, more likely to interrupt someone
- goal activation and persistence
    - how do we know if something is a goal?
    - if the goal is blocked, then be bothered (Zeigarnik effect)
    - (Ovsiankina effect) if it is really a goal, will find some way to accomplish it
    - fishing study. There is a board game, dillema game, take fish out of ocean, if too much is taken out, everybody loses.
    - if you want to win at all costs, game will end quickly
    - if you want to be a communal person, then will be co-operative, people will be happier over the course of the game
    - game is played over an hour
    - if a goal prime like crossword puzzle changed the behaviour in this game, that shows that it is a goal
    - indeed people took more fish faster if primed with the acheivement goal
    - people more likely to cooperate if they took the loving puzzle
    - people more likely to cheat when not watched after taking the acheivement puzzle
    - asked them if behaviour affected by crossword puzzles, everyone said of course not
    - two different goal-primed conditions and either obstacle or not
    - achievement condition wanted to complete the goal that was disrupted, even if meant forgo the funny task
    - meant that achieving was a goal, wanted to persist in the face of an obstacle

- first alternative explanation for displacement
    - if someone wants to control you, their control in another domain was blocked, and so they now want to control you
- mystery moods
 - foul mood but don't know why, or good mood
 - some unconscious goal either got fulfilled or blocked
 - acheivement primed people were upset when they lose something dumb, like a card game
- doesn't matter if goal is conscious or unconscious
 - goal shielding occurs when you supress everything that is irrelevant to a certain goal
- automatic inhibition of fulfilled goals
 - watching for the word "aggression" to appear, say there it is, and get a prize
 - goal is to notice the word aggression
 - gives them an aggresion related goal
 - lexical decision task: string of letters comes on the screen, have to say whether it is a word or not (word vs not word)
 - kicked, turtle, asdfds, repeated many times
 - researcher is interested in speed, how fast do you recognize kicked as a word, and turtle as a word
 - 50 words like kicked, 50 neutral words like turtle
 - interested to see how accessible the elements of the aggression schema are
 - now have an aggression goal, that should activate nodes related to aggression
 - should be really quick at identifying related words
 - unrelated words haven't been primed, so they should be slower

### Automatic inhibition of stimuli related to fulfilled goals

- before they had the aggression goal, words were lexically decided with the same speed
- during aggression goal, aggression related words were more accessible - more quickly noticable
- reaction time faster
- other words became slower
- this is goal shielding
- when you have a goal, can't process all information
- brain strips away things that are unrelated to the goal
- after aggression goal (test finished), aggression words slowed down, other words were faster
 - forget everything after a test
 - inhibit goal related things after we complete it
- brain automatically giving "goal goggles"
- Karl Jung thought the universe was conspiring to give you messages about what is useful/relevant to you
- goal-myopia

### Goal conflict

Approach oriented when we are pursuing goals. But shit happens, we got obstacles/restriction. This is an approach avoidance conflict, get an ERN response.

Next get anxious vigilance, scan for viable alternatives, then resume eager approach. 

We sometimes try to suppress anxious thought.

Might ask someone to think about their death and write about their rotting flesh. About 7000 studies with this manipulation. If after that, fill in word stems with first word that comes to mind.

S K _ _ _
CO _ _ _ _
D E _ _

What comes to people's minds is SKUNK, COFFEE, DEER.
If you give them five minutes, you get SKULL, COFFIN, DEAD.

### Thought suppression and rebound

People try and suppress thoughts. Try to think about other things. Eventually remember that you're looking at this to distract yourself from the thought.

- thoughts come bouncing back later
- same for threats
- if you fail a test, or someone criticizes you, these are threats
- put them out of your mind
- but this suppression activates the BIS, threats become contagious
- you become vigilant in the domain of threat, become more self conscious, find other threats
- all the effort to suppress thoughts takes its toll, associated with decreased self control
- that makes you unable to persist at subsequent tasks
- ego-depletion theory
- will is limited, can run out, interesting theory
- get tired faster

### Ego depletion and self-control failure

- thought suprression takes a psychic toll
- trying not to be sad is really hard
- people randomly assigned to watch a sad/happy movie and not show any emotion
- or have people do a stroop test
 - "ignore the word, just tell me the colour"
 - have to suppress the meaning
 - doing this many times causes the same outcome as suppressing emotion
 - every impulse that you inhibit takes a psychic toll
 - conflicts then activate the BIS
- ignore cookies when hungry
- loss of persistence and self control
- brought couples into a magazine study
- sat next to each other
- the male was given a softporn magaine
- told to assess the layour for quality
- really looked at how long he oggled the nudity pages, while the girlfriend was sitting next to him
- after they were depleted, were more likely to oggle the pictures in front of the gf
- taste test after fasting
- taste as much as they are required to tell the taste
- deplete them by getting them to not show emotion
- if they are depleted, they will binge
- people who come into an experiment, randomly assigned to ego-depletion or not, then write an essay about something, then get feedback from experimenter
- "worst essay i've ever seen"
- then get a chance to rate the experimenter (to decide who to fire)
- depleted and insulted people tore into the experimenter more than the non-depleted people
- people lose their self control after a prior exercise of self control
- depletion causes spontaneous increase in BAS
- people more likely to take risks, confident, dopamine
- people don't want to activate BIS even more
- don't want to do something that makes you even more anxious when you are anxious
- BAS downregulates the anxious distress
- second explanation for displacement:
- already anxious BIS -> unwilling to suppress more
- study found that when you give people a sugary drink, replenish them and they can engage in more self control
- swishing sugary drink in mouth and spit it out also helps people resist more
- putting sugar on a baby's tongue activates approach motivation in brain (left frontal)

### Angry Approach

- strongly engaging an approach goal may be one way to protect self from anxiety of threats
- agression is approach-oriented
- angry approach shields one from distress/unceratinty frustration
- third explanation for apparent displacement of anger:


__missed a lot of stuff here__

Approach is negatively correlated with life stress and with ERN.

### Eager Displacement Goals

Some rats (when anxious) will nibble off their own whiskers, or run on a treadmill to the point of death, even when food is available.

Cats will lick themselves compulsively. Dogs will bark/lick themselves compuslively. Displacement goal that animals do when they are anxious. Zoo animals will vocalize compulsively when distressed. Vets often give them SSRIs. 

Humans like to think about ideals or our future or donald trump, or whatever it is that inspires us.

### Sex and conflict

- approach pleasure/love/romance/security/dominance/submission/comfort/children
- very powerfully related to powerful hormones
- lot of potent qualities
- also a lot of things that can go wrong:
 - insecurity, rejection
 - morals
 - neuroses
 - body anxiety
 - feeling like an animal
 - performance fears
 - vulnerability
- some people romanticize it to make it about ideals of love
- study done by mortality-salience researches
- what happens when you remind people of their own mortality, what will it do to their sex drive?
- mortality salience blocks peoples goals, makes them anxious
- anxious people want to activate approach system
- can achieve concrete goals or ideals
- what they found was that mortality salience made anxious people have less sex, but more interest in romance/love, activated BAS
- for anxious people, what is salient about sex is the bad things
- non-anxious people, they get more interested in physical sex when reminded of their mortality
- non-anxious people, for them the good parts of sex are more salient
- ideals are a huge part of human goals
- as we get older, death becomes more salient, it is nice to have an idealistic focus to activate BAS

### Ideals as abstract goals

- ideals are high-level goals, meanings, values, worldviews
- their purpose is to guide concrete goals
- people can also use these ideas for palliative systems
- "go to happy place"
- they don't cost anything
- don't have to do anything to activate them, just polish them
- contemplate abstractions, greeks were all about this too
- "shielding the self" with transcendent ideals
- feel better by focusing on ideals
- enhance supervalent thoughts
- some people instead "escape the self" within concrete experiences (non-neurotic people and sex)
- "god" and "chocolate" significantly decreased the amplitude of the ERN

### Motivational for idealistic integrity

- conflict activates ideals, goes to approach, all the conflict falls away, is forgotten

- the extent to which people become approach motivated is mediated by ideals
- ideals are the levers used to activate personality processes

### Approaching personal project efficacy and happiness

- efficacy (outcome success, determination, competence) is a very high predictor of happiness
- positive affect if reducing discrepancy
- happiness: more positive feelings and less stress and depression
- behavioural activation helps with depression, do something, anything that can activate the approach system
- can be small wins
- breaking things down into small wins allows people to reduce discrepancy more often/better
- motivational speakers: when you achieve your goals, you feel happier
- have a goal card in your wallet that says your goals
- you see that and it primes your goal, you complete it more, notice stuff relevant to your goals more
- motivational speakers shifted to "what on earth am i here for, why, why do i want to succeed"
- these questions become more salient for older adults

2 different kinds of wellbeing, second kind is more meaningful. The goals you identify and find meaning more are more important.

### Meaning vs Happiness

If high on happiness, might have more meaning. Distal "being", more meaning, proximal "doing" more happiness. Predicted by different kinds of goals.

Integrity predicts meaning.

Parenthood paradox: if you ask people what the best thing in ther lives are, they say children. But if you measure people's happiness, they are least happy while they are parenting. Crazy pit of despair when people have children. But when asked, they say children are the happiest thing. People are making it up because they feel dumb for having children.

As people get older, they become more interested in meaning, happiness becomes less focal.

Meaning and void: habituate to things that make you happy quickly. For goal perspective, want idealistic goals becuase you never reach it and habituate. Move towards goals and sustain this well being. Goal attainment is a curse to well-being. 

Temporal world is disillusioning, want transcnedant goals to pursue, beyond temporal world. 

But efficacy is important. What is optimal is integrated efficacy, succeeding at something that you care about.

Efficacy predicts meaning really high in Waterloo students. Doing well is very important for UW students. Key part of identity. Later in life, studying high level senior managers in Canadian gov't, achieved a lot. Asked them about efficacy/integrity, efficacy did not predict well-being at all, instead it was integrity. This is called the "integrity shift". 

### Meaning Quest

Hopeless problem did not activate meaning, give up.

Remind people of goal frustration significantly increases quest for meaning in life.

Goal conflict does this even more.

## Week 7 - Illusion (Feb 23) 

Had to miss this class, two midterms the next day :( 

<a name="week8"></a>
## Week 8 - Security (March 1) 

Assumption that you need basic trust at the beginning of your journey through life - maybe mother matters more than we think in development?

### Dismissive Attachment

Cope with relationship distress by saying "I don't need people, get away from me, I can function on my own." Good short term solution for a child, growing up, when they have unresponsive parents. 

These kinds of people might be this way because they think they are great themselves. Positive model of themselves, high efficacy. (true dismissive)

Other group - fearful, low efficacy. Want to be close to people but think that you will be rejected.

Fearful types - this strategy hurts themselves and others.
High efficacy - hurts themselves and others.

Truly dismissive people tend to be hypomanic and have high bas-drive. They have high anger, are individualistic, narcisstic, and low wisdom. 
Wisdom = recognizing that other people's persepctives are important/worth considering. Not that good at recognizing the perspectives of others. 
Higher stress, depression, neuroticism. 
Hyper agentic. 
Poor performance on the eyes talk. People who are amped up on approach motivation are less capable of considering others. 

Fearful types are low hypomanic, low bas drive, not narcisstic. Caustic style. 

### House of Atreus (Mycenaeans)

Myths begin of vivid depictions of callous parents. Tantalus cut up and cooked his kids, for his own benefit. Others cut off hands and feet of kids, etc. 

### Oedipus

Also bound and exposed, left out to die by his parents. 

### Virgin Mary (Manta Maria, Notre Dame)

Selfless loving parenting, connected with exceptional individuals. Eg. Mary with Jesus.

All connected with idea that parenting matters.

### Freud: Psychosexual Development

Issues during development cause complexes or fixation in adulthood.

### Maslow

Must have secure self and feeling of belonging before you can have highest function (self-actualization). 

Dismissive people (don't want to belong/connect) are associated with low self control, efficacy, integrity, and authenticity. 

### Goals in Stage Theories of Personal Development

Belongingness is a basic primate/human need to connect to ours. If you can't consolidate this connection, that will always be an incomplete goal. Implicit goal, will prime connection related activations. 

Become fixated on complexes, cause neuroses/delayed development (according to Freud).

May cause mystery moods. Relationship goals blocked/unfinished, might give you sudden moods. When goals are active/unfunfilled, will always be scanning for related goals. 

Once goals are fulfilled, we actively supress things related to finished goals. Eg. affirmation by getting invited to something, you relax about these goals. 

### Stages of psychosocial development

Erikson

1. Basic trust: will people respond when I have needs?
 Will I not feel that others around me are indifferent to my existance.
2. Autonomy
3. Initiative
4. Industry
5. Identity
6. Intimacy
7. Generativity
8. Integrity

### Basic Trust vs. Mistrust

Neosocial theorists, focused on social more than sexual. 

Karen Horney thought that parental indifference was the worst thing for a developing child. Causes basic anxiety. She foreshadowed attachment style research. Studied how children respond to indifference. 

She thought that one way was basic hostility - angry approach. Some move towards, basically ask for attention. Some move against, others move away from.

She outlined 10 neurotic needs, ways that people entangle themselves in drama. Try to extract the attention/responsiveness that they want. 

### Bowlby and Ainsworth: Attachment theory

Observed mothers and children at the park. 
Some children explored, and their mothers were responsive when they returned. Kids free to explore and then come back to the secure base.

Other kids would be always bothering the mom, and the mom would ask them to go explore. These kids wouldn't leave much. Bowlby got the idea of parents as a secure base. 

Strange situation: useful diagnostic that was useful for looking at whether kids would be secure, anxious, or dismissive. 

Child is placed under some kind of stress. New situation. Parent will often leave. Will study the _reunion_ to identify the attachment style. 

Strage adult enters new room, reads a magazine. Stranger attempts to interact with child. Soon after, mother leaves the room. Then the stranger will try to interact with the child, trying to comfort the child. Then mother returns. 

Stranger leaves later, then mom leaves. Child is on their own. Then stranger returns, and tries to console (in vain). Then mother returns. This is the second reunion. Baby is calmed almost at once. This is secure attachment. 

Secure infants have a period of appropriate distress, and then they are relatively easily consoled. Relatively exploring.

Anxious infants are very distressed, have odd reaction when mom returns. Partly relieved/happy, but also partly angry. Also sometimes remain distressed. 

Dismissives show little distress. They are aloof when mom returns. Other studies show that even though they appear to not care, their physiological measures show an increase in stress. It's thought that this is a defence against highly stressful situation. 

Researcher observed parenting for two weeks, then brought them into the lab for the strange situation.

In secure kids, mom was responsive, learn to trust her. "I can count on my mom."

Anxious kids, sometimes the mom was responsive, and sometimes not. Mom goes away - this might be okay, or might not, this conflict causes anxiety.

For dismissive kids, their parents are usually not responsive. 

Attention is not always good attention, need responsiveness, not making them amuse you. 

Maybe this is reverse causation? Hard to be responsive when the kid is dismissive. 

### Adult Attachment Style

Hard to get at the cause of adult personality.
Might be seeing what they want to see. 

Bowlby thought that attachment dynamics were evolutionariliy adaptive. Adaptively significant for humans to have adaptive attachment styles, because situtations change. 

Dismissiveness might be a way to get the anxiety to stop. Too hard to want something that you will never have, will eventually stop wanting it.

Proposed that dismissive attachment style is maladaptive - doesn't serve a useful function.

True dismissives are high BAS. Anxious are high BIS. 

Hard to experimintally determine responsive parenting with humans. In the 50s, researchers were doing this with monkeys.

### The Learning Assumption

Assumption: contingencies learned in childhood persist into adulthood. 

Harlow was a colleague of Maslow.

Freud thought that all we needed from our parents was libidinal (sexual). Young child was oral and needed oral satisfaction. Harlow seperated baby monkeys from child. Had a wire mom that had oral stimulation (botle) and cloth mom that had no oral, but had bonding and attachment/responsiveness. Determined what was better for the primate.

Some monkeys withdrew and became very self contained. 

Monkeys raised with wire mothers were socially stunted, became poor mother themselves.

### Twin Studies on Attachment Style

Most excited that 35% of adult dismissive type comes from parents. Very bad parents matter. Consistently nonresponsive. 

Some psychiatrists think parents should be giving 5 minutes of responsive attention to each child every day, that's it. 

If you parent in a certain way, your kids will be a certain way. 

Anxiety is the less bad form of bad parenting. Thankfully, child anxious attachment is generally not persistent into adult attachment as a result of parenting. 

We are less self-sufficient than we think. Intimately wired to connect, oxytocin, mirror neurons. 

### Social Pain and the Power of Touch

People often use metaphors of pain for emotions (eg. heartbreak, torn, etc). Some researchers thought that this maybe was become the social pain is registered the same way as pain.

Acetaminophen dulls the ERN response for angular cingulate cortex. 

fMRI study: same area of brain affected by social and physical pain. His kid wanted ice because her feelings were hurt. 

Gave people 3 weeks of tylenol, sent them out with beepers. Had people respond with how socially pained they are feeling. Other half on placebos. People who were on tylenol experience less social pain. Tylenol is bad for your liver, don't do it so often. 

Women come into lab, get put into MRI machine, are told they will have electric shocks. Randomly assigned to hold husband's hand, stranger's hands, or no hands.

Hand holding decreased activity in BIS.

Other studies asked people how many times they had a hug in a week. But we aren't met to be super antisocial. People with fewer hugs had less oxytocin and higher blood pressure/heart rate. 

Oxytocin decreases ACC-ERN. Released by touch.

Kangaroo care: power went out in a incubator ward for premature babies. Nurses put them between their breasts, they had better prognoses. 

### Empathy

Assessed people's qualities - some predicted empathy 26 years later.

These were:

- dad involved
- mom ok with dependence
- happy mom
- maternal inhibition of childhood aggression

Better at noticing the eyes and emotions of others.

Secure/warm connection to other people allows us to be more empathetic, better parents. 

Oxytocin increases perspective-taking for some autistic people. 

Brief touch/therapy improved some therapy. 

Waitresses how touch their clients briefly received 27% higher tips. 

Some stuides where they ask people to volounteer, more generous/willing to helo if touched.

Bum patting. Preseason in NBA, looked how much the guys touched each other (eg. chest bumps, butt pat) predicted performance in the season. 

Seeing your distress activates my ACC, that's how empathy works. Must be able to have an ACC response (won't if hopped up on anger). 
Persistent anxiety will cause RAM (reactive approach motivation) to mute ACC.
Also sociopaths/aggressive delinquints have muted ACC activity. 

Don't want too much ACC reactivity - flooded with anxiety. Also don't want to cut off ACC altogether, like hyper-agentic people, or dismissive people. 

### Empathy questionarre

Males who have more testosterone are lower on empathy. High inter uterinal testosterone also less empathy.
Both less eye contact.

### Resilience

Secure attachment and muted ACC-ERN.

Stress did not change ERN for securely attached people. 

Many studies show that if you make people ostracized/rejected, they become hostile, are more willing to shock other people. Become caustic. Give people personality tests, then give them false feedback, tell them that they will end up alone. Control condition gives just scores.

People become antisocial when rejected. 

Teddy bear effect. Future alone, no one wants to work with you. In these conditions with angry responses, either hold teddy bear, or just look at teddy bear. Holding the teddy bear eliminated the angry response to social rejection. 

### Success

Often times minorities who get into prestigious schools like Stanford, their marks drop in first term, just like everybody. Minorities start to underperform and drop off. 

Maybe it's because they feel like they don't belong? Randomly assigned people who were either African/European American to have a belongingness manipulation or not. Manipulation was "it's hard here, marks drop, you still belong here."

Belongingness group did better accross the board.
